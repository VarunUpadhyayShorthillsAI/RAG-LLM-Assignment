It may be caused by the eyeball being too small or the focusing power being too weak. It can also be a combination of both. Farsightedness is often present from birth. However, children have a very flexible eye lens, which helps make up for the problem. As aging occurs, glasses or contact lenses may be needed to correct the vision.

These changes may be passed down (inherited) through families. The most severe form of albinism is called oculocutaneous albinism. People with this type of albinism have white or pink hair, skin, and iris color. They also have vision problems. Another type of albinism, called ocular albinism type 1 (OA1), affects only the eyes. The person's skin and eye color are usually in the normal range. However, an eye exam will show that there is no coloring in the back of the eye (retina). Hermansky-Pudlak

Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS) -- This is the rarest type. Males and females have equally severe disease. With all types of Alport syndrome, the kidneys are affected. The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood. At first, there are no symptoms. Over time, as the glomeruli are more and more damaged, kidney function is lost and waste products and fluids build up in the body. The condition can progress to end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed. Symptoms The main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear.

This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason. A brain aneurysm may begin to leak a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe headache that a person may describe as ""the worst headache of my life."" It may be called a thunderclap or sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a future rupture that may occur days to weeks after the headache first started. Symptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain. Symptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm, whether it breaks open, and what part of the brain it is pushing on.

aneurysm that has ruptured. Other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture may include: Confusion, no energy , sleepiness , or� stupor Eyelid drooping Headaches with nausea or vomiting Muscle weakness or difficulty moving any part of the body Numbness or decreased sensation in any part of the body Problems speaking Seizures Stiff neck (occasionally) Vision changes (double vision, loss of vision) Loss of consciousness ( coma ) NOTE: A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. Call 911 or the local emergency number. Exams and Tests An eye exam may show signs of increased pressure in the brain, including swelling of the optic nerve or bleeding into the retina of the eye. A clinical exam may show abnormal eye movement, speech, strength, or sensation. The following tests may be used to diagnose an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm and determine the cause of bleeding in the brain: Cerebral angiography or spiral CT angiogram (CTA) of the head to show the location and size of the aneurysm Spinal tap CT scan of the head Electrocardiogram (ECG) MRI of the head or MRI angiogram (MRA) Treatment Two common methods are used to repair a brain aneurysm . Clipping is done during open brain surgery (craniotomy)

(splenic artery aneurysm) Certain factors or conditions may increase the risk for aneurysms including: High blood pressure (thoracic, abdominal and cerebral aneurysms) High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Illicit drug use (cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine) Pregnancy (often linked to splenic artery aneurysms) Family history (sibling, parent, or child) Inherited disorders that may increase the risk include: Fibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal cell growth in artery walls) Marfan syndrome � Polycystic kidney disease Coarctation of the aorta Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) Symptoms The symptoms depend on where the aneurysm is located. If the aneurysm occurs near the body's surface, pain and swelling with a throbbing lump is often seen. Aneurysms in the body or brain often cause no symptoms. Aneurysms in the brain may expand without breaking open (rupturing). The expanded aneurysm may press on nerves and cause double vision, dizziness, or headaches. Some aneurysms may cause ringing in the ears. If an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur. When a brain aneurysm ruptures, there is a sudden severe headache that some people say is the ""worst headache of my life."" The risk of neurologic injury, coma , or death after a rupture is high.

What is the treatment for Aneurysm?,". Endovascular repair is most often done. It usually involves placing a very small coil and possibly a stent (called coiling and stenting) into or around the aneurysm. This is a less invasive and most common way to treat aneurysms. Not all aneurysms need to be treated right away. Those that are very small (less than 3 mm or 0.12 in) are less likely to break open. Your health care provider will help you decide whether or not it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can break open. Sometimes people are too ill to have surgery, or it may be too dangerous to treat the aneurysm because of its location. A ruptured aneurysm is an emergency that needs to be treated right away. Treatment may involve: Being admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) Complete bed rest and activity restrictions Drainage of blood from the brain area (cerebral ventricular drainage) Medicines to prevent seizures Medicines to control headaches and blood pressure Medicines to prevent vasospasm, which is a constriction of the arteries of your brain, leading to decreased blood flow Once the aneurysm is repaired, treatment may be needed to prevent a stroke

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests used to diagnose an aneurysm include: CT scan CT angiogram MRI MRA ( magnetic resonance angiogram ) Ultrasound Angiogram Treatment Treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm. Your provider may only recommend regular checkups to see if the aneurysm is growing. Surgery may be done. The type of surgery that is done and when you need it depend on your symptoms and the size and type of aneurysm. Surgery may involve a large (open) surgical cut. Many times, a procedure called endovascular embolization is done. Coils or stents of metal are inserted into a brain aneurysm to make the aneurysm clot. This reduces the risk for rupture while keeping the artery open. Other brain aneurysms may need to have a clip placed on them to close them off and prevent a rupture. Aneurysms of the aorta may be reinforced with surgery to strengthen the blood vessel wall. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop a lump on your body, whether or not it is painful and throbbing. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you

done through the radial artery in the wrist A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is passed through the open skin and into the artery. Dye is injected through this tube so that the blood vessel can be seen on x-ray images. The doctor gently moves the catheter through the blood vessel up to the area being treated. Once the catheter is in place, the doctor places small plastic particles, glue, metal coils, foam, or a balloon through it to seal off the faulty blood vessel. (If coils are used, it is called coil embolization.) This procedure can take several hours. Why the Procedure is Performed The procedure is most often used to treat aneurysms in the brain. It can also be used for other medical conditions when open surgery might be risky. The goal of the treatment is to prevent bleeding in the problem area and to reduce the risk that the blood vessel feeding it will break open (rupture). Your doctor will help you decide whether it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can rupture. This procedure may be used to treat: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) Brain aneurysm Carotid artery cavernous fistula (a

to prevent it from breaking open (bursting). During endovascular repair (surgery) of an aneurysm: You may have general anesthesia and a breathing tube. Or, you may be given medicine to relax you, but not enough to put you to sleep. A catheter is guided through a small cut in your groin into and through the femoral artery and then guided through your arteries until it reaches the artery in your brain where the aneurysm is located. Contrast material is injected through the catheter. This allows the surgeon to view the arteries and the aneurysm on a monitor in the operating room. Thin metal wires are put into the aneurysm. They then coil into a mesh ball. For this reason, the procedure is also called coiling. Blood clots that form around this coil prevent the aneurysm from breaking open and bleeding. Sometimes stents (mesh tubes) are also put in to hold the coils in place and make sure the blood vessel stays open. During and right after the procedure, you may be given a blood thinner, such as heparin, clopidogrel, or aspirin. These medicines prevent dangerous blood clots from forming in the stent.

Endovascular repair (surgery), most often using a coil or coiling and stenting (mesh tubes), is a less invasive and more common way to treat aneurysms. During aneurysm clipping: You are given general anesthesia and a breathing tube. Your scalp, skull, and the coverings of the brain are opened. Your brain is gently retracted to reach the aneurysm. A metal clip is placed at the base (neck) of the aneurysm","Treatment for aneurysms depends on their size, location, and whether they have ruptured. For unruptured aneurysms, regular checkups may be recommended if they are small and not growing. For larger or growing aneurysms, treatment may involve endovascular repair, surgery, or a combination of both.

Endovascular repair often involves the use of a catheter to insert small plastic particles, glue, metal coils, foam, or a balloon to seal off the faulty blood vessel. This is done to prevent the aneurysm from rupturing.

Surgery may be done when endovascular repair is not possible or effective. The type of surgery","The treatment for an aneurysm depends on its size, location, and whether it has ruptured or not. Here are some treatment options:

1. **Regular Checkups**: If the aneurysm is small (less than 3 mm or 0.12 in) and hasn't ruptured, your provider may just recommend regular checkups to monitor its growth.

2. **Surgery**: If the aneurysm is large or has ruptured, surgery may be needed. There are two main types of surgery:
   - **Endovascular Repair ( Coiling and Stenting)**: This is a less invasive and more common way to treat aneurysms. It involves placing a very small coil and possibly a stent (a mesh tube) into or around the aneurysm. This is done through a small cut in your groin and guided through the arteries to the aneurysm.
   - **Clipping**: This is done during an open craniotomy (a surgical operation where a bone flap is temporarily removed from the skull to access the brain). A metal clip is placed at the base of the aneurysm to close it off and prevent a rupture.

3. **Medicines**: These may be given to prevent seizures, control headaches and blood pressure, and prevent vasospasm (constriction of the arteries in the brain).

4. **Other Treatments**: In case of a ruptured aneurysm, treatments may involve complete bed rest, drainage of blood from the brain area, and intensive care.

Controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis may reduce the likelihood of some types of aneurysms. People who are known to have an aneurysm may need regular visits with their provider to make sure the aneurysm is not changing size or shape. If unruptured aneurysms are discovered in time, they can be treated before causing problems or monitored with regular imaging (usually yearly).

The liver makes a large amount of glucose. Fat is broken down too rapidly for the body to process. The fat is broken down by the liver into a fuel called ketones. Ketones are normally produced by the liver when the body breaks down fat after it has been a long time since your last meal. These ketones are normally used by the muscles and the heart. When ketones are produced too quickly and build up in the blood, they can be toxic by making the blood acidic. This condition is known as ketoacidosis.

Common asthma triggers include: Animals (pet hair or dander) Dust mites Certain medicines (aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) Changes in weather (most often cold weather) Chemicals in the air (pollution) or in food Physical activity Mold Pollen Respiratory infections, such as the common cold and many other viruses Strong emotions (stress) Tobacco or other inhalant that is smoked Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma . The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals. Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies , such as hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ) or eczema . Others have no history of allergies. Symptoms Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. For example, you may have symptoms all the time or mostly during physical activity.

They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take these medicines every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK. Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your provider will prescribe the right medicine for you. QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken: For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or during an asthma attack Just before physical activity to help prevent asthma

may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, drug allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Outlook (Prognosis) Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it.

Lung inhaler Pills Injection People with severe allergic symptoms may be prescribed corticosteroid pills or injections for short periods. DECONGESTANTS Decongestants help relieve a stuffy nose. Do not use decongestant nasal spray for more than several days because they can cause a rebound effect and make the congestion worse. Decongestants in pill form do not cause this problem. People with high blood pressure, heart problems, or prostate enlargement should use decongestants with caution. OTHER MEDICINES Leukotriene inhibitors are medicines that block the substances that trigger allergies. People with asthma and indoor and outdoor allergies may be prescribed these medicines. ALLERGY SHOTS Allergy shots ( immunotherapy ) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the allergen and your symptoms are hard to control. Allergy shots keep your body from over-reacting to the allergen. You will get regular injections of the allergen. Each dose is slightly larger than the last dose until a maximum dose is reached. Allergy shots are only used for environmental allergies (pollens, pet dander, dust) or venom allergies. These shots do not work for everybody and you will have to visit the provider often.

Treatment Severe allergic reactions ( anaphylaxis ) need to be treated with a medicine called epinephrine. It can be life-saving when given right away. If you use epinephrine, call 911 or the local emergency number and go straight to the hospital. The best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This is especially important for food and medicine allergies. There are several types of medicines to prevent and treat allergies. Which medicine your provider recommends depends on the type and severity of your symptoms, your age, and overall health. Illnesses that are caused by allergies (such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema) may need other treatments. Medicines that can be used to treat allergies include: ANTIHISTAMINES Antihistamines are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are available in many forms, including: Capsules and pills Eye drops Injection Liquid Nasal spray CORTICOSTEROIDS These are anti-inflammatory medicines. They are available in many forms, including: Creams, lotions, and ointment for the skin Eye drops Nasal spray","The treatment for asthma involves a combination of long-term and quick-relief medicines, lifestyle changes, and avoiding triggers.

Tests for the allergen that caused anaphylaxis (if the cause is not obvious) may be done after treatment. Treatment Anaphylaxis is an emergency condition that needs medical attention right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately. Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR . Call 911 or

nose or mouth into the airways. Or emergency surgery will be done to place a tube directly into the trachea . The person may receive medicines to further reduce symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) Anaphylaxis can be life threatening without prompt treatment. Symptoms usually do get better with the right therapy, so it is important to act right away.

Or, go to the nearest emergency room. Prevention To prevent allergic reactions and anaphylaxis: Avoid triggers such as foods and medicines that have caused an allergic reaction in the past. Ask detailed questions about ingredients when you are eating away from home. Also carefully examine ingredient labels. If you have a child who is allergic to certain foods, introduce one new food at a time in small amounts so you can recognize an allergic reaction. People who know that they have had serious allergic reactions should wear a medical ID tag or bracelet. If you have a

seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours. Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes or hours of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition. Without treatment, anaphylaxis can get worse very quickly and lead to death within 15 minutes. Causes Common allergens include: Animal dander Bee stings or stings from other insects such as fire ants Foods, especially milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish Medicines Pollens Symptoms Common symptoms of a mild allergic reaction include: A few hives (especially over the neck and face) Itching Nasal congestion Rashes Watery, red eyes Symptoms of a moderate or severe reaction include: Abdominal pain Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Chest discomfort or tightness Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, wheezing Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Flushing or redness of the face Hives all over Nausea� or vomiting Palpitations Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness First Aid For a mild to moderate reaction: Calm and reassure the person having the reaction.

There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. Treatment The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment

Topics Kidney Diseases Pain Relievers Title: Anaphylaxis Causes Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen . An allergen is a substance that, for most people, is harmless, but in some people, it can cause an allergic reaction. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis usually happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body. Tissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms. Some medicines (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (often called an anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include: Medicine allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings Pollen and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some","Symptoms of Anaphylaxis include:

1. Abdominal pain or cramping
2. Confusion
3. Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice
4. Dizziness
5. Fainting, lightheadedness
6. Hives over different parts of the body
7. Nausea, vomiting
8. Rapid pulse
9. Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations)
10. Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema)

What is the treatment for Anaphylaxis?,"may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, drug allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Outlook (Prognosis) Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it.

Topics Kidney Diseases Pain Relievers Title: Anaphylaxis Causes Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen . An allergen is a substance that, for most people, is harmless, but in some people, it can cause an allergic reaction. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis usually happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body. Tissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms. Some medicines (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (often called an anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include: Medicine allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings Pollen and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some

A blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies. Treatment LIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS The best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure . You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered. For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda. Treatments for allergic rhinitis include: ANTIHISTAMINES Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following: Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this","The treatment for Anaphylaxis is usually urgent and requires immediate medical attention. The most important step is to administer epinephrine, which can be life-saving when given right away. After using epinephrine, it's crucial to call 911 or the local emergency number and proceed to the hospital.

In addition to epinephrine, other treatments may be given in a hospital setting to further reduce symptoms and manage complications. These may include:

1. Medications to open up the airways and improve breathing.
2. Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.
3. Intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration.
4","The treatment for anaphylaxis involves using a medicine called epinephrine immediately. Epinephrine can be life-saving and should be injected right away if you suspect anaphylaxis. After using epinephrine, you should call 911 or the local emergency number and go straight to the hospital. Avoiding known allergens is crucial to prevent future reactions. Other medications like antihistamines and corticosteroids may also be used to further reduce symptoms, but epinephrine is the first line of treatment.",0.9292842149734497,0.41666666666666663,0.9575079083442688,0.38028169014084506,0.7839660584926605

Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, drug allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Outlook (Prognosis) Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it.

What are the symptoms of Alkalosis?,"level or increased bicarbonate (a base) level makes the body too alkaline, a condition called alkalosis. There are different types of alkalosis. These are described below. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by a low carbon dioxide level in the blood. This can be due to: Fever Being at a high altitude Lack of oxygen Liver disease Lung disease, which causes you to breathe faster ( hyperventilate ) Aspirin poisoning Metabolic alkalosis is caused by too much bicarbonate in the blood. It can also occur due to certain kidney diseases. Hypochloremic alkalosis is caused by an extreme lack or loss of chloride, such as from prolonged vomiting. Hypokalemic alkalosis is caused by the kidneys' response to an extreme lack or loss of potassium. This can occur from taking certain water pills (diuretics). Compensated alkalosis occurs when the body returns the acid-base balance to near normal in cases of alkalosis, but bicarbonate and carbon dioxide levels remain abnormal. Symptoms Symptoms of alkalosis can include any of the following: Confusion (can progress to stupor or coma) Hand tremor Lightheadedness Muscle twitching Nausea, vomiting Numbness or tingling in the face, hands, or feet Prolonged muscle spasms (tetany) Exams and Tests Your health care provider will

perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Laboratory tests that may be ordered include: Arterial or venous blood gas analysis . Electrolytes test, such as basic metabolic panel to confirm alkalosis and show whether it is respiratory or metabolic alkalosis. Other blood tests may be needed to determine the cause of the alkalosis. Other tests may be needed to determine the cause of the alkalosis. These may include: Chest x-ray Urinalysis Urine pH Treatment To treat alkalosis, your provider needs to first find the underlying cause. For alkalosis caused by hyperventilation, breathing into a paper bag allows you to keep more carbon dioxide in your body, which improves the alkalosis. If your oxygen level is low, you may receive oxygen. Medicines may be needed to correct chemical loss (such as chloride and potassium). Your provider will monitor your vital signs (temperature, pulse, rate of breathing, and blood pressure). Outlook (Prognosis) Most cases of alkalosis respond well to treatment. Possible Complications Untreated or not treated properly, complications may include any of the following: Arrhythmias (heart beating too fast, too slow, or irregularly) Coma Electrolyte imbalance (such as low potassium level ) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your

provider if you become confused, unable to concentrate, or unable to ""catch your breath."" Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if there is: Loss of consciousness Rapidly worsening symptoms of alkalosis Seizures Severe breathing difficulties Prevention Prevention depends on the cause of the alkalosis. People with healthy kidneys and lungs do not usually have serious alkalosis. Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Metabolic Disorders Title: Alkaptonuria Causes A defect in the HGD gene causes alkaptonuria. The gene defect makes the body unable to properly break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. As a result, a substance called homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and other body tissues. The acid leaves the body through the urine. The urine turns brownish-black when it mixes with air. Alkaptonuria is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.

Your symptoms may be worse when there is more pollen in the air. Higher levels of pollen are more likely on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground. Mold, animal dander, or dust mites may cause this problem also. Allergies tend to run in families. It is hard to know exactly how many people have allergies. Many conditions are often lumped under the term ""allergy"" even when they might not truly be an allergy.

The immune response that causes an allergic reaction is similar to the response that causes hay fever. Most reactions happen soon after contact with an allergen. Many allergic reactions are mild, while others can be severe and life threatening. They can be confined to a small area of the body, or they may affect the entire body. The most severe form is called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. Allergic reactions occur more often in people who have a family history of allergies . Substances that don't bother most people (such as venom from bee stings and certain foods, medicines, and pollens) can trigger allergic reactions in certain people. First-time exposure may produce only a mild reaction. Repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions. Once a person has had an exposure or an allergic reaction (and thus is sensitized to an allergen), even a very limited exposure to a very small amount of allergen can trigger a severe reaction. Most severe allergic reactions occur within

Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. Skin testing is more likely to be done if symptoms do not respond to treatment. Treatment The best treatment is to avoid what causes your allergy symptoms as much as possible. Common triggers to avoid include dust, mold and pollen. Some things you can do to ease symptoms are: Use lubricating eye drops. Apply cool compresses to the eyes. Do not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Take over-the-counter oral antihistamines or antihistamine or decongestant eye drops. These medicines can offer more relief, but they can sometimes make your eyes dry. (Do not use the eye drops if you have contact lenses in place. Also, do not use the eye drops for more than 5 days, as rebound congestion can occur).

The chance is higher if your mother has allergies. Symptoms Symptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens. Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. If your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances.

drops can be prescribed for more severe reactions. You may also use eye drops that prevent a type of white blood cell called mast cells from causing swelling. These drops are given along with antihistamines. These medicines work best if you take them before you come in contact with the allergen. Referral to an ophthalmologist before using steroid eye drops should be done since intraocular pressure measurements and a more thorough eye exam (using a slit lamp) is needed.

Risks There is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Serum ammonia; Encephalopathy - ammonia; Cirrhosis - ammonia; Liver failure - ammonia Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Brain Diseases Liver Diseases Title: Ammonia poisoning Poisonous Ingredient The poisonous ingredient is: Ammonia Where Found Ammonia can be found in: Ammonia gas Some household cleaners Some liniments Some fertilizers Note: This list may not be all-inclusive. Symptoms Symptoms can affect many parts of the body. AIRWAYS, LUNGS, AND CHEST Cough Chest pain (severe) Chest tightness Difficulty breathing Rapid breathing Wheezing BODY-WIDE

If ammonium hydroxide is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes. If the person swallowed ammonium hydroxide, give them milk or water right away. You may also give them fruit juice. But, do not give anything to drink if they have symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions , or a decreased level of alertness . If the person breathed in fumes, move them to fresh air right away.

may include: Activated charcoal Intravenous fluids (IV, given through a vein) Laxative Medicine to treat symptoms Shock to the heart, for serious heart rhythm disturbances Breathing support, which may include oxygen or a ventilator (tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine) Dialysis (kidney machine), in severe cases Outlook (Prognosis) Convulsions and irregular heartbeats may be difficult to control. Some symptoms may occur up to 12 hours after the overdose. Death may occur with large overdoses, especially in very young or old people. Alternative Names Theophylline overdose; Xanthine overdose Title: Ammonia blood test How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test Your health care provider may ask you to stop taking certain drugs that may affect test results. These include: Alcohol Acetazolamide Barbiturates Diuretics Narcotics Valproic acid You should not smoke before your blood is drawn. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed Ammonia (NH 3 ) is produced by cells throughout the

body, especially the intestines, liver, and kidneys. Most of the ammonia produced in the body is used by the liver to produce urea. Urea is also a waste product, but it is much less toxic than ammonia. Ammonia is especially toxic to the brain. It can cause confusion, low energy, and sometimes coma. This test may be done if you have, or your provider thinks you have, a condition that may cause a toxic buildup of ammonia. It is most commonly used to diagnose and monitor hepatic encephalopathy , a severe liver disease. Normal Results The normal range is 15 to 45 µ/dL (11 to 32 µmol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results may mean you have increased ammonia levels in your blood. This may be due to any of the following: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding , usually in the upper GI tract Genetic diseases of the urea cycle High body temperature (hyperthermia) Kidney disease Liver failure Low blood potassium level (in people with liver disease) Parenteral nutrition (nutrition by

Outlook (Prognosis) Damage is related to the amount and strength (concentration) of the ammonia. Most household cleaners are relatively weak and cause little or mild damage. Industrial strength cleaners can cause severe burns and injury. Survival past 48 hours most often indicates recovery will occur. Chemical burns that occurred in the eye frequently heal; however, permanent blindness may result.

ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Fluids through the vein (intravenous or IV) Laxative Medicines to treat symptoms Other medicines may be given through a vein, including potassium salt and sodium bicarbonate, which helps the body remove aspirin that has already been absorbed. If these treatments do not work or the overdose is extremely severe, hemodialysis (kidney machine) may be needed to reverse the condition. In rare cases, a breathing machine may be needed. Many poisoning experts think this causes more harm than good, so it is only used as a very last resort. Outlook (Prognosis) A toxic dose of aspirin is 200 to 300 mg/kg (milligrams per kilogram of body weight), and ingestion of 500 mg/kg is potentially lethal. In chronic overdose a lower level of aspirin in the body can result in serious illness. Much lower levels can affect children. If treatment is delayed or the overdose is large enough, symptoms will continue to get worse. Breathing becomes extremely fast or may stop. Seizures, high fevers, or death may occur.

If there is a high level of acetaminophen in the blood, the person will be given N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) as soon as possible. This medicine is called an antidote. It counteracts the effects of the acetaminophen. Without it, deadly liver failure may occur. Several doses may be required until the blood level drops to a safer value. If there are signs of a severe opioid overdose, the antidote naloxone will be given. Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does, depends on the amount of medicine swallowed and how quickly the treatment was received.

Exams and Tests Depending on the cause, a nervous system (neurologic) examination is done to identify the problems. Tests to diagnose a medical condition causing the dementia may include: Ammonia level in the blood Blood chemistry , electrolytes Blood glucose level BUN , creatinine to check kidney function Liver function tests Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to measure chemistry of the spinal fluid Nutritional assessment Thyroid function tests Urinalysis Vitamin B12 level To check for certain brain disorders, an electroencephalogram (EEG), head CT scan , or head MRI scan is usually done. Treatment The aim of treatment is to manage and correct the underlying disorder and control symptoms. With some metabolic disorders, treatment may stop or even reverse the dementia symptoms. Medicines used to treat Alzheimer disease have not been shown to work for these types of disorders. Sometimes, these medicines are used anyway, when other

of dementia are nonreversible and degenerative. Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back. Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia. Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia . It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke. Lewy body disease is another cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. Any condition that results in injury to the brain can cause dementia. The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia: Huntington disease Brain injury Frontotemporal degeneration (Pick disease) Multiple sclerosis Infections such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis , and Lyme disease Parkinson disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Excess alcohol use Brain trauma Some causes of dementia, such as those due to abnormal chemical processes in the body , may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: Brain injury Brain tumors Long-term (chronic) alcohol abuse Changes in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levels Low vitamin B12 level Normal pressure hydrocephalus Use of certain medicines, including cimetidine and some cholesterol medicines Some brain infections Symptoms Dementia symptoms include difficulty","The treatment for Alzheimer disease focuses on slowing the progression of the disease, managing symptoms, and supporting the person and their caregivers.

Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia. Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia . It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke. Lewy body disease is another cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. Any condition that results in injury to the brain can cause dementia. The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia: Huntington disease Brain injury Frontotemporal degeneration (Pick disease) Multiple sclerosis Infections such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis , and Lyme disease Parkinson disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Excess alcohol use Brain trauma Some causes of dementia, such as those due to abnormal chemical processes in the body , may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: Brain injury Brain tumors Long-term (chronic) alcohol abuse Changes in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levels Low vitamin B12 level Normal pressure hydrocephalus Use of certain medicines, including cimetidine and some cholesterol medicines Some brain infections Symptoms Dementia symptoms include difficulty

amount of beta amyloid protein in the brain Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion Before using these medicines, ask your provider: What are the side effects? Is the medicine worth the risk? When is the best time, if any, to use these medicines? Do medicines for other health problems need to be changed or stopped? Someone with Alzheimer disease will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can help by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems . It is important to make sure the home of a person who has Alzheimer disease is safe for them . Support Groups Having Alzheimer disease or caring for a person with the condition may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by seeking support through Alzheimer disease resources . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) How quickly Alzheimer disease gets worse is different for each person. If Alzheimer disease develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly. People with Alzheimer disease often die earlier than normal, although a person

MedlinePlus Health Topics Lung Diseases Title: Alzheimer - resources Alternative Names Resources - Alzheimer Title: Alzheimer disease Causes The exact cause of Alzheimer disease is not known. Research shows that certain changes in the brain are associated with Alzheimer disease. This leads to structures called neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Most experts believe that this is the cause of Alzheimer disease but why this happens to some people is not known. You are more likely to develop Alzheimer disease if you: Are older -- Developing Alzheimer disease is not a part of normal aging. Have a close relative, such as a brother, sister, or parent with Alzheimer disease. Have certain genes linked to Alzheimer disease. The following may also increase the risk: Being female Having heart and blood vessel problems due to high cholesterol History of head trauma There are two types of Alzheimer disease: Early onset Alzheimer disease -- Symptoms appear before age 60. This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified. Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and","Although there is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer disease, there are some measures that may help prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer disease. These include:

It may occur at any age, but is most common in people ages 25 to 60. In some people, the problem may be inherited. Symptoms Symptoms include: Backflow (regurgitation) of food Chest pain , which may increase after eating, or may be felt as pain in the back, neck, and arms Cough Difficulty swallowing liquids and solids Heartburn Unintentional weight loss Exams and Tests Physical exam may show signs of anemia or malnutrition . Tests include: Esophageal manometry , a test to measure if your esophagus is working properly. Functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP). Creates a high resolution 3D image of your esophagus and its movements. EGD or upper endoscopy, a test to examine the lining of the stomach and esophagus. It uses a flexible tube and camera. Upper GI x-ray . Treatment The goal of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the sphincter muscle and allow food and liquids to pass easily into the stomach. Therapy may involve: Injection with botulinum toxin (Botox) -- This may help relax the sphincter muscles. However, the

Symptoms Symptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes. They may include any of the following: Abdominal pain Feeling anxious Chest discomfort or tightness Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, or high-pitched breathing sounds Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Hives , itchiness, redness of the skin Nasal congestion Nausea or vomiting Palpitations Slurred speech Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine the person and ask about what might have caused the condition. Tests for the allergen that caused anaphylaxis (if the cause is not obvious) may be done after treatment. Treatment Anaphylaxis is an emergency condition that needs medical attention right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately. Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR . Call 911 or

It confirms the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis in people who have symptoms. Nearly one half of people with myasthenia gravis that is limited to their eye muscles (ocular myasthenia gravis) have this antibody in their blood. This antibody can also be present in the blood of people who have a thymoma, with or without myasthenia gravis. However, the lack of this antibody does not rule out myasthenia gravis. About 1 in 5 people with myasthenia gravis do not have signs of this antibody in their blood. Your health care provider may also consider testing you for the muscle specific kinase (MuSK) or other antibodies. Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Myasthenia Gravis Title: Achalasia Causes There is a muscular ring at the point where the esophagus and stomach meet. It is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow food to pass into the stomach. In people with achalasia, it does not relax as it should. In addition, the normal muscle activity of the esophagus (peristalsis) is reduced or absent. This problem is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus. Other problems can cause similar symptoms, such as cancer of the esophagus or

Symptoms Symptoms vary, depending on the cause. But some symptoms are common to all types of airway blockage. These include: Agitation or fidgeting Bluish color of the skin ( cyanosis ) Changes in consciousness Choking Confusion Difficulty breathing , gasping for air, leading to panic Unconsciousness (lack of responsiveness) Wheezing , crowing, whistling, or other unusual breathing noises indicating breathing difficulty Exams and Tests The health care provider will do a physical examination and check the airway. The provider will also ask about the possible cause of the blockage. Tests are usually not necessary, but may include: Bronchoscopy (tube through the mouth into the trachea and bronchial tubes) Laryngoscopy (tube through the mouth into the back of the throat and voicebox) X-rays or CT scan (computerized tomography) Treatment Treatment depends on the cause of the

There are genetic tests to look for the causes of some forms of the disorder. But, no specific test is available in many cases. An MRI of the brain may show changes in the size of affected brain structures, especially as the disease gets worse. But it is possible to have the disorder and have a normal MRI. Other tests such as positron emission tomography (PET) may be done to rule out other conditions. These may include swallowing studies","The symptoms of Achalasia include backflow (regurgitation) of food, chest pain (which may increase after eating or may be felt as pain in the back, neck, and arms), cough, difficulty swallowing liquids and solids, heartburn, unintentional weight loss, and difficulty swallowing.

What is the treatment for Achalasia?,"benefit wears off within a few weeks or months. Medicines, such as long-acting nitrates or calcium channel blockers -- These medicines can be used to relax the lower esophagus sphincter. But there is rarely a long-term solution with medicines to treat achalasia. Surgery (called a myotomy) -- In this procedure, the lower sphincter muscle is cut. This procedure is usually performed using a laparoscope. It can now sometimes be performed during EGD instead of traditional surgery. Widening (dilation) of the esophagus -- This is done during EGD by stretching the LES with a balloon dilator. Your health care provider can help you decide which treatment is best for you. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcomes of surgery and non-surgical treatments are similar. However, depending on the type of achalasia you have, your provider may recommend a particular procedure. More than one treatment is sometimes necessary.

Physical therapy, rehabilitation, use of braces or a wheelchair, or other measures may be needed to help with muscle function and general health. Ongoing oversight by a physical medicine provider is helpful, given continuously changing symptoms. People with ALS tend to lose weight. The illness itself increases the need for food and calories. At the same time, problems with choking and swallowing make it hard to eat enough. To help with feeding, a tube may be placed into the stomach. A dietitian who specializes in ALS can give advice on healthy eating. Breathing devices include machines that are considered non-invasive (such as CPAP or BiPAP). Others require tube in the trachea (invasive ventilation). Medicine for depression may be needed if a person with ALS is diagnosed with depression. They also should discuss their wishes regarding artificial ventilation with their families and providers. Support Groups Emotional support is vital in coping with the disorder,

Treatment If you are allergic to a medicine, your provider may tell you to stop taking it. Never stop taking a medicine without first talking with your provider. If the condition is due to an infection, you may be treated with an antibiotic or antiparasitic medicine. Sometimes, anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids are given, especially if you have aspergillosis. Outlook (Prognosis) The disease often goes away without treatment. If treatment is needed, the response is usually good. But, the disease can come back, especially if the condition does not have a specific cause and needs to be treated with corticosteroids.

People with healthy kidneys and lungs do not usually have serious alkalosis. Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Metabolic Disorders Title: Alkaptonuria Causes A defect in the HGD gene causes alkaptonuria. The gene defect makes the body unable to properly break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. As a result, a substance called homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and other body tissues. The acid leaves the body through the urine. The urine turns brownish-black when it mixes with air. Alkaptonuria is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. Symptoms Urine in an infant's diaper may darken and can turn almost black after several hours. However, many people with this condition may not know they have it. The

Symptoms may include: Arthritis (especially of the spine) that gets worse over time Darkening of the ear Dark spots on the white of the eye and cornea Exams and Tests A urine test is done to test for alkaptonuria. If ferric chloride is added to the urine, it will turn the urine black in people with this condition. Treatment Management of alkaptonuria has traditionally been focused on controlling symptoms. Eating a low protein diet may be helpful, but many people find this restriction difficult. Medicines, such as NSAIDs and physical therapy may help relieve joint pain. Clinical trials are underway for other drugs to treat this condition and to assess whether the drug nitisinone provides long-term help with this illness.

Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS) -- This is the rarest type. Males and females have equally severe disease. With all types of Alport syndrome, the kidneys are affected. The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood. At first, there are no symptoms. Over time, as the glomeruli are more and more damaged, kidney function is lost and waste products and fluids build up in the body. The condition can progress to end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed. Symptoms The main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear. KIDNEYS Other symptoms of kidney problems include: Abnormal urine color Blood in the urine that is visible during a cold or flu or exercise Flank pain High blood

They are due to the bacteria growing in large numbers inside the body. Symptoms include: Fever and chills Joint and muscle pain Headache Vomiting The infection with bacteria causes bleeding throughout the body, which causes: A rash throughout the body Disseminated intravascular coagulation in which small blood clots cut off blood supply to the organs Septic shock Bleeding into the adrenal glands makes the glands unable to produce enough adrenal hormones. This is called adrenal crisis, and it leads to symptoms such as: Dizziness, weakness Very low blood pressure Very fast heart rate Confusion or coma Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Blood tests will be done to confirm a bacterial infection. Tests may include: Blood culture Complete blood count with differential Blood clotting studies If your provider suspects the infection is caused by meningococcus bacteria, other tests that may be done include: Lumbar puncture to get a sample of spinal fluid for culture Skin biopsy and Gram stain Urine analysis Tests that may

to 3 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria. This time is called the incubation period. Most people have no symptoms. Others may have moderate symptoms similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may last for several weeks. Common symptoms may include: Dry cough (nonproductive) Fever Headache Joint pain (arthralgia) Muscle pains Other symptoms that may develop include: Abdominal pain Chest pain Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) Rash Exams and Tests A physical exam may reveal abnormal sounds (crackles) in the lungs or an enlarged liver or spleen. In the late stages of the disease, a heart murmur may be heard. Tests that may be done include: A chest x-ray to detect pneumonia or other changes in the lungs Blood tests to check for antibodies to Coxiella burnetti Liver function test Complete blood count (CBC) with differential Tissue staining of infected tissues to identify the bacteria Electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram (echo) to look at the heart for damage caused by the Coxiella burnetti bacteria Treatment Treatment with antibiotics can shorten the length of the illness. Antibiotics that are commonly used include tetracycline and doxycycline. Pregnant women or children who still have any baby

other areas of the body. The infection may affect the skin, bones and joints,� genitals and urinary� tract, and other systems. Skin symptoms are a sign of widespread (disseminated) blastomycosis. Symptoms In many people, skin symptoms develop when the infection spreads beyond their lungs. Papules , pustules , or nodules are most frequently found on exposed body areas. They may look like warts or ulcers. They are usually painless. They may vary from gray to violet in color. The pustules may: Form ulcers Bleed easily Occur in the nose or mouth Over time, these skin lesions can lead to scarring and loss of skin color (pigment). Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine your skin and ask about symptoms. The infection is diagnosed by identifying the fungus in a culture taken from a skin lesion. This usually requires a skin biopsy . Treatment This infection is treated with antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole. Either oral or intravenous (directly in the vein) drugs are used, depending on the drug and stage of the disease. Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on the form of blastomycosis and on your immune system. People with a

sample must be sent for a urine culture . Most people with no urinary tract symptoms do not need this test. You may need a urine culture done as a screening test, even without symptoms, if: You are pregnant You have a surgery or procedure planned that involves the bladder, prostate, or other parts of the urinary tract To make the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria, the culture must show a large growth of bacteria. In men, only one culture needs to show growth of bacteria In women, two different cultures must show growth of bacteria Treatment Most people who have bacteria growing in their urine, but no symptoms, do not need treatment. This is because the bacteria are not causing any harm. In fact, treating people with this problem may make it harder to treat infections in the future.

Treatment usually includes antibiotics and surgery. In some cases, antibiotics alone are used. Antibiotics are usually given through a vein (IV) for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Some people need to take them for a longer time, depending on the type of bacteria and how severe the disease is. Surgery may be needed to drain or remove the abscess. Surgery is also often needed to reduce pressure on the spinal cord or brain, if there

What are the symptoms of Absent pulmonary valve?,"valve is missing or does not work well, blood does not flow efficiently to the lungs to get enough oxygen. In most cases, there is also a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart ( ventricular septal defect ). This defect will also lead to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body. The skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis), because the body's blood contains a low amount of oxygen. Absent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged (dilated) branch pulmonary arteries (the arteries that carry blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen). They can become so enlarged that they press on the tubes that bring the oxygen into the lungs (bronchi). This causes breathing problems. Other heart defects that can occur with absent pulmonary valve include: Abnormal tricuspid valve Atrial septal defect Double outlet right ventricle Ductus arteriosis Endocardial cushion defect Marfan syndrome Tricuspid atresia Absent left pulmonary artery Heart problems that occur with absent pulmonary valve may be due to defects in certain genes. Symptoms Symptoms can vary depending on which other defects the infant has, but may include: Blue coloring to the skin (cyanosis) Coughing Failure to thrive Poor appetite Rapid breathing

Respiratory failure Wheezing Exams and Tests Absent pulmonary valve may be diagnosed before the baby is born with a test that uses sound waves to create an image of the heart (echocardiogram). During an exam, the health care provider may hear a murmur in the infant's chest. Tests for absent pulmonary valve include: Heart CT scan Chest x-ray Echocardiogram Electrocardiogram (ECG) test to measure the electrical activity of the heart Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart Treatment Infants who have respiratory symptoms typically need surgery early. Infants without severe symptoms most often have surgery within the first 3 to 6 months of life or later. Depending on the type of other heart defects the infant has, surgery may involve: Closing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect) Closing a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis) Enlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs Types of surgery for absent pulmonary valve include: Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (pulmonary plication

involves putting saline solution inside the uterus) Treatment Treatment depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Normal monthly periods� most often� return after the condition is treated. A lack of menstrual period due to obesity , vigorous exercise, or weight loss may respond to a change in exercise routine or weight control (gain or loss, as needed).

It is more commonly considered if there is no genetic or acquired predisposition to bronchiectasis (for example, more likely to consider if there is bronchiectasis in one segment of the lung only because of prior obstruction). In severe cases, lung transplantation might be needed.� Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on the specific cause of the disease. With treatment, most people live without major disability and the disease progresses slowly. Possible Complications Complications of bronchiectasis may include:","The treatment for Absent pulmonary valve often involves surgery, especially for infants with respiratory symptoms. The specific type of surgery may include:

1. Closing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect).
2. Closing a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis).
3. Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways.
4. Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (pulmonary plication).

In some cases","The treatment for Absent Pulmonary Valve typically involves surgery. The type and timing of surgery depend on the severity of symptoms and other heart defects the infant has. Here are some options:

1. **Early surgery**: For infants with respiratory symptoms.
2. **Surgery within the first 3 to 6 months or later**: For infants without severe symptoms.

Surgery may involve:
- Closing a hole in the heart (ventricular septal defect) or a blood vessel (ductus arteriosis).
- Enlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs.
- Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways.
- Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways.
- Replacing the abnormal pulmonary valve with one taken from human or animal tissue.
- Rebuilding the windpipe and breathing tubes to the lungs.

Infants with severe breathing symptoms may need oxygen or a breathing machine (ventilator) before and after surgery. The outlook is generally very good with surgery.",0.8916327357292175,0.4719999999999999,0.9165793061256409,0.71875,0.7732268861293792
How can Absent pulmonary valve be prevented?,"Respiratory failure Wheezing Exams and Tests Absent pulmonary valve may be diagnosed before the baby is born with a test that uses sound waves to create an image of the heart (echocardiogram). During an exam, the health care provider may hear a murmur in the infant's chest. Tests for absent pulmonary valve include: Heart CT scan Chest x-ray Echocardiogram Electrocardiogram (ECG) test to measure the electrical activity of the heart Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart Treatment Infants who have respiratory symptoms typically need surgery early. Infants without severe symptoms most often have surgery within the first 3 to 6 months of life or later. Depending on the type of other heart defects the infant has, surgery may involve: Closing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect) Closing a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis) Enlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs Types of surgery for absent pulmonary valve include: Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (pulmonary plication

involves putting saline solution inside the uterus) Treatment Treatment depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Normal monthly periods� most often� return after the condition is treated. A lack of menstrual period due to obesity , vigorous exercise, or weight loss may respond to a change in exercise routine or weight control (gain or loss, as needed). Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Many of the conditions that cause secondary amenorrhea will respond to treatment. When to Contact a Medical Professional See your primary health care provider or women's health care provider if you have missed more than one period so you can get diagnosed and treated, if needed. Alternative Names Amenorrhea - secondary; No periods - secondary; Absent periods - secondary; Absent menses - secondary; Absence of periods - secondary Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Menstruation Title: Absent pulmonary valve Causes Absent pulmonary valve occurs when the pulmonary valve does not form or develop properly while the baby is in the mother's womb. When present, it often occurs as part of a heart condition called tetralogy of Fallot . It is found in about 3% to 6% of people who have tetralogy of Fallot. When the pulmonary

valve is missing or does not work well, blood does not flow efficiently to the lungs to get enough oxygen. In most cases, there is also a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart ( ventricular septal defect ). This defect will also lead to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body. The skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis), because the body's blood contains a low amount of oxygen. Absent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged (dilated) branch pulmonary arteries (the arteries that carry blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen). They can become so enlarged that they press on the tubes that bring the oxygen into the lungs (bronchi). This causes breathing problems. Other heart defects that can occur with absent pulmonary valve include: Abnormal tricuspid valve Atrial septal defect Double outlet right ventricle Ductus arteriosis Endocardial cushion defect Marfan syndrome Tricuspid atresia Absent left pulmonary artery Heart problems that occur with absent pulmonary valve may be due to defects in certain genes. Symptoms Symptoms can vary depending on which other defects the infant has, but may include: Blue coloring to the skin (cyanosis) Coughing Failure to thrive Poor appetite Rapid breathing

oxygen may speed this process. The provider may put in a chest tube if you also have a collapsed lung. You may also need treatment for the cause of the problem. A hole in the trachea or esophagus needs to be repaired with surgery. Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on the disease or events that caused the pneumomediastinum. Possible Complications Air may build up and enter the space around the lungs (pleural space), causing the lung to collapse. In rare cases, air may enter the area between the heart and the thin sac that surrounds the heart. This condition is called a pneumopericardium. In other rare cases, so much air builds up in the middle of the chest that it pushes on the heart and the great blood vessels, so they cannot work properly. All of these complications require urgent attention because they can be life threatening.

Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS) -- This is the rarest type. Males and females have equally severe disease. With all types of Alport syndrome, the kidneys are affected. The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood. At first, there are no symptoms. Over time, as the glomeruli are more and more damaged, kidney function is lost and waste products and fluids build up in the body. The condition can progress to end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed. Symptoms The main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear. KIDNEYS Other symptoms of kidney problems include: Abnormal urine color Blood in the urine that is visible during a cold or flu or exercise Flank pain High blood

uncommon in people with ADAS. Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The following tests may be done: BUN and serum creatinine Complete blood count Renal biopsy Urinalysis If your provider suspects you have Alport syndrome, you will also likely have vision and hearing tests. Treatment The goals of treatment include monitoring and controlling the disease and treating the symptoms. Your provider may recommend any of the following: A diet that limits salt, fluids, and potassium Medicines to control high blood pressure Kidney disease is managed by: Taking medicines to slow kidney damage A diet that limits salt, fluids, and protein Hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids. Eye problems are treated as needed. For example, an abnormal lens due to lenticonus or cataracts can be replaced. Genetic counseling may be recommended because the disorder is inherited.

is an autoimmune disorder . This means your immune system mistakenly targets healthy cells and tissues in the body. With LEMS, antibodies produced by the immune system attack nerve cells. This makes nerves cells unable to release enough of a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical transmits impulses between nerves and muscles. The result is muscle weakness. LEMS may occur with cancers such as small cell lung cancer or autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo , which leads to a loss of skin pigment. LEMS affects men more often than women. The most common age of occurrence is around age 60 years. LEMS is rare in children. Symptoms Weakness or loss of movement that can be more or less severe, including: Difficulty climbing stairs, walking, or lifting things Muscle pain Drooping of the head The need to use the hands to get up from a sitting or lying position Problems talking Problems chewing or swallowing, which may include gagging or choking Vision changes, such as blurry vision , double vision, and problem keeping a steady gaze Weakness is generally mild in LEMS.

Some wild animals and ticks also carry these bacteria. You can get Q fever by drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk, or after breathing in dust or droplets in the air that are contaminated with infected animal feces, blood, or birth products. People at risk for infection include slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, researchers, food processors, and sheep and cattle workers. Men are infected more often than women. Most people who get Q fever are age 30 to 70 years. In rare cases, the disease affects children, especially those who live on a farm. In infected children younger than 3 years old, Q fever is usually noticed while looking for the cause of pneumonia . Symptoms Symptoms usually develop 2

produce antibodies. Antibodies attach to a specific antigen and make it easier for the immune cells to destroy the antigen. T lymphocytes attack antigens directly and help control the immune response. They also release chemicals, known as cytokines, which control the entire immune response. As lymphocytes develop, they normally learn to tell the difference between your own body tissues and substances that are not normally found in your body. Once B cells and T cells are formed, a few of those cells will multiply and provide ""memory"" for your immune system. This allows your immune system to respond faster and more efficiently the next time you are exposed to the same antigen. In many cases, it will prevent you from getting sick. For example, a person who has had chickenpox or has been immunized against chickenpox is immune from getting chickenpox again. Watch this video about: Immune response INFLAMMATION The inflammatory response (inflammation) occurs when tissues are injured by bacteria, trauma, toxins, heat, or any other cause. The damaged cells release chemicals including histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins. These chemicals cause blood vessels to leak fluid into the tissues, causing swelling . This helps isolate the foreign substance from further contact","There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders as they are often caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors. However, some lifestyle changes such as maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing stress may help in reducing the risk or alleviating symptoms.

What are the symptoms of Arthritis?,"This means the immune system of the body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. RA can occur at any age, but is more common in middle age. Women get RA more often than men. Infection, genes, and hormone changes may be linked to the disease. Smoking may also be linked to RA. It is less common than osteoarthritis (OA) which is a joint condition that occurs in many people due to wear and tear on the joints as they age. Symptoms Most of the time, RA affects joints on both sides of the body equally. Fingers, wrists, knees, feet, elbows, ankles, hips and shoulders are the most commonly affected. The lower spine is usually not affected by RA. The disease often begins slowly. Early symptoms may include: Minor joint pain Stiffness Fatigue Joint symptoms may include: Morning stiffness, which lasts more than 1 hour, is common. Joints may feel warm, tender, and stiff when not used for an hour. Joint pain is often felt in the same joint on both sides of the body. Joints are often swollen. Over time, joints may lose their range of motion and may become deformed. Other symptoms include: Chest pain when taking a breath ( pleurisy

Joint inflammation and damage may result from: An autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue) Broken bone General ""wear and tear"" on joints Infection, most often by bacteria or viruses Crystals such as uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate In most cases, the joint inflammation goes away after the cause goes away or is treated. Sometimes, it does not. When this happens, you have long-term (chronic) arthritis. Arthritis may occur in people of any age and sex. Osteoarthritis , which is due to non-inflammatory processes and increases with age, is the most common type. Other, more common types of inflammatory arthritis include: Ankylosing spondylitis Crystal arthritis, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (in children) Bacterial infections Psoriatic arthritis Reactive arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (in adults) Scleroderma Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Symptoms Arthritis causes joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited movement.

Symptoms of this condition are: Loss of control of emotions, with bouts of unusual crying or laughing Quick, jerky movements that mainly affect the face, feet, and hands Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine you and will carefully check your heart sounds, skin, and joints. Tests may include: Blood test for prior strep infection (such as an ASO test) Complete blood count (CBC) Electrocardiogram (ECG) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR -- a test that measures inflammation in the body) Several factors called major and minor criteria have been developed to help diagnose rheumatic fever in a standard way. The major criteria for diagnosis include: Arthritis in several large joints Heart inflammation Nodules under the skin Rapid, jerky movements (chorea,

arthritis affects women more often than men. It is most common among sexually active young adults. Gonococcal arthritis occurs when the bacteria spread through the blood to a joint. Sometimes, more than one joint is infected. Symptoms Symptoms of joint infection may include: Fever Joint pain for 1 to 4 days Pain in the hands or wrists due to tendon inflammation Pain or burning during urination Single joint pain Skin rash (sores are slightly raised, pink to red, and may later contain pus or appear purple) Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms. Tests will be done to check for a gonorrhea infection. This may involve taking samples of tissue, joint fluids, or other body material and sending them to a lab for examination under a microscope. Examples of such tests include: Cervical Gram stain Culture of joint aspirate Joint fluid Gram stain Throat culture Urine test for gonorrhea Treatment The gonorrhea infection must be treated. There are two aspects of treating a sexually transmitted disease, especially one as easily spread as gonorrhea. The first is to cure the infected person. The second is to locate, test, and treat all

What is the treatment for Arthritis?,"Biologic medicines are often added to methotrexate. However, because they are very expensive, insurance approval is generally required. Most of them are given either under the skin or into a vein. There are now many different types of biologic agents. Biologic and synthetic agents can be very helpful in treating RA. However, people taking these medicines must be watched closely because of uncommon, but serious adverse reactions: Infections from bacteria, viruses, and fungi Skin cancer, but not melanoma Skin reactions Allergic reactions Worsened heart failure Damage to nerves Low white blood cell count SURGERY Surgery may be needed to correct severely damaged joints. Surgery may include: Removal of the joint lining ( synovectomy ) Total joint replacement, in extreme cases, may include total knee replacement (TKR) and hip replacement . PHYSICAL THERAPY Range-of-motion exercises and exercise programs prescribed by a physical therapist can delay the loss of joint function and help keep muscles strong. Sometimes, therapists will use special machines to apply deep heat or electrical stimulation to reduce pain and improve joint movement. Other therapies that may help ease joint pain include: Joint protection techniques Heat and cold treatments Splints or orthotic devices to support and align joints Frequent

done include: Complete blood count (CBC) Metabolic panel and serum uric acid CRP ESR Antinuclear antibody Tests for hepatitis Joint x-rays Joint ultrasound or MRI Joint fluid analysis Treatment RA most often requires long-term treatment by an expert in arthritis called a rheumatologist. Treatment includes: Medicines Physical therapy Exercise Education to help you understand the nature of RA, your treatment options, and the need for regular follow-up. Surgery, if required Early treatment for RA with medicines called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be used in all patients. This will slow joint destruction and prevent deformities. The activity of the RA should be checked at regular visits to make sure the disease is under control. The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the RA. MEDICINES Anti-inflammatory medicines: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen and celecoxib. These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible. Since they do not prevent joint damage if used alone, DMARDs should be used as well. Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These are

rest periods between activities, as well as 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night NUTRITION Some people with RA may have intolerance or allergies to certain foods. A balanced nutritious diet is recommended. It may be helpful to eat foods rich in fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Smoking cigarettes should be stopped. Excessive alcohol should also be avoided. Support Groups More information and support for people with RA and their families can be found by taking part in an arthritis support group. Some people may benefit from taking part in an arthritis support group . Outlook (Prognosis) Whether your RA progresses or not depends on the severity of your symptoms and your response to treatment.

Blood tests used to diagnose some common types of anemia may include: Blood levels of iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, and other vitamins and minerals Complete blood count Reticulocyte count Other tests may be done to find medical problems that can cause anemia. Treatment Treatment should be directed at the cause of the anemia, and may include: Blood transfusions Corticosteroids or other medicines that suppress the immune system Erythropoietin, a medicine that helps your bone marrow make

Causes The bone marrow is mostly responsible for making new red cells. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the bone marrow isn't making enough red cells to replace the ones that are being destroyed. There are several possible causes of hemolytic anemia. Red blood cells may be destroyed due to: An autoimmune problem in which the immune system mistakenly sees your own red blood cells as foreign substances and destroys them Genetic variations within the red cells (such as sickle cell anemia , thalassemia , and G6PD deficiency ) Exposure to certain chemicals, medicines, and toxins Infections Blood clots in small blood vessels Transfusion of blood from a donor with a blood type that does not match yours Faulty, damaged, or artificial heart valves Symptoms You may not have symptoms if the anemia is mild.

What is the treatment for Anemia?,"spleen (splenectomy) may be considered. You may receive treatment to suppress your immune system if you do not respond to steroids. Medicines such as azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and rituximab (Rituxan) have been used. Blood transfusions are given with caution, because the blood may not be compatible and it may cause more red blood cell destruction. Outlook (Prognosis) The disease may start quickly and be very serious, or it may stay mild and not need special treatment. In most people, steroids or splenectomy can totally or partially control anemia. Possible Complications Severe anemia rarely leads to death. Severe infection may occur as a complication of treatment with steroids, other medicines that suppress the immune system, or splenectomy. These treatments impair the body's ability to fight infection. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you have unexplained fatigue or chest pain, or signs of infection. Prevention Screening for antibodies in donated blood and in the recipient may prevent hemolytic anemia related to blood transfusions. Alternative Names Anemia - immune hemolytic; Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Anemia Title: Immune response Information The immune system protects the body from possibly harmful substances by recognizing and

year of life. Other symptoms can include: Bone deformities in the face Fatigue Growth failure Shortness of breath Yellow skin (jaundice) People with the minor form of alpha and beta thalassemia have small red blood cells but no symptoms. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do a physical exam to look for an enlarged spleen. A blood sample will be sent to a laboratory to be tested. Red blood cells will appear small and abnormally shaped when looked at under a microscope. A complete blood count (CBC) reveals anemia. A test called hemoglobin electrophoresis shows the presence of an abnormal form of hemoglobin and can detect beta thalassemia. A test called mutational analysis can help detect alpha thalassemia. Treatment Treatment for thalassemia major often involves regular blood transfusions and folate supplements. If you receive blood transfusions, you should not take iron supplements. Doing so can cause a high amount of iron to build up in the body, which can be harmful. People who receive a lot of blood transfusions need a treatment called chelation therapy. This is done to remove excess iron from the body. A bone marrow transplant may help treat the disease in some people, especially

as that caused by cancer or HIV/AIDS may require: Blood transfusion Erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, given as a shot Outlook (Prognosis) The anemia will improve when the disease that is causing it is treated. Possible Complications Discomfort from symptoms is the main complication in most cases. Anemia may lead to a higher risk for death in people with heart failure. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have a long-term (chronic) disorder and you develop symptoms of anemia. Alternative Names Anemia of inflammation; Inflammatory anemia; AOCD; ACD; Anemia of chronic inflammation Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Anemia Title: Anemia Causes Although many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with

Blood hemoglobin Treatment In most cases, no treatment is needed. Folic acid supplements may help your body produce normal red blood cells and improve the symptoms of the anemia. Outlook (Prognosis) People with hemoglobin C disease can expect to lead a normal life. Possible Complications Complications may include: Anemia Gallbladder disease Enlargement of the spleen When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of hemoglobin C disease. Prevention You may want to seek genetic counseling if you are at high risk for the condition and are considering having a baby. Alternative Names Clinical hemoglobin C Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Anemia Blood Disorders Title: Hemoglobin electrophoresis How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. In the lab, the technician places the blood sample on special paper and applies an electric current. The hemoglobins move on the paper and form bands that show the amount of each type of hemoglobin. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is necessary for this test. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may

Hormone therapy combined with low doses of steroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) is prescribed to those who do not have a bone marrow donor. Most people respond to hormone therapy. But everyone with the disorder will quickly get worse when the medicines are stopped. In most cases, these medicines eventually stop working. Additional treatments may include: Antibiotics (possibly given through a vein) to treat infections Blood transfusions to treat symptoms due to low blood counts Human papilloma virus and other vaccines Most people with this condition visit a doctor on regular basis, specializing in treating: Blood disorders (hematologist) Diseases related to glands (endocrinologist) Eye diseases (ophthalmologist) Bone diseases (orthopedist) Kidney disease (nephrologist) Diseases related to female reproductive organs and breasts (gynecologist) Outlook (Prognosis) The survival rates vary from person to person. The outlook is poor in those with low blood counts. New and improved treatments, such as bone marrow transplants, have likely improved survival. People with Fanconi anemia are more likely to develop several types of blood disorders and cancers.

What are the symptoms of Allergic reactions?,"seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours. Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes or hours of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition. Without treatment, anaphylaxis can get worse very quickly and lead to death within 15 minutes. Causes Common allergens include: Animal dander Bee stings or stings from other insects such as fire ants Foods, especially milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish Medicines Pollens Symptoms Common symptoms of a mild allergic reaction include: A few hives (especially over the neck and face) Itching Nasal congestion Rashes Watery, red eyes Symptoms of a moderate or severe reaction include: Abdominal pain Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Chest discomfort or tightness Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, wheezing Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Flushing or redness of the face Hives all over Nausea� or vomiting Palpitations Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness First Aid For a mild to moderate reaction: Calm and reassure the person having the reaction. Anxiety can make symptoms worse. Try to identify the allergen and have the person avoid further contact

may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems, eczema , and asthma , worse. Symptoms Mostly, the part of the body the allergen touches determines what symptoms you develop. For example: Allergens that you breathe in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, and wheezing . Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash , hives , itching, blisters, or skin peeling. Medicine allergies and food allergies may involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms. At times, an allergy can trigger a response that involves the entire body. Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions, such as when the allergy symptoms occur. Allergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual allergy or are caused by other problems. For example, eating contaminated food ( food poisoning ) may cause symptoms similar to food allergies. Some medicines (such as aspirin and ampicillin) can produce non-allergic reactions, including rashes. A runny nose or cough may actually be due to an infection. Skin testing is the

Alternative Names Conjunctivitis - allergic seasonal/perennial; Atopic keratoconjunctivitis; Pink eye - allergic Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Allergy Pink Eye Title: Allergic reactions Considerations Allergic reactions are common. The immune response that causes an allergic reaction is similar to the response that causes hay fever. Most reactions happen soon after contact with an allergen. Many allergic reactions are mild, while others can be severe and life threatening. They can be confined to a small area of the body, or they may affect the entire body. The most severe form is called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. Allergic reactions occur more often in people who have a family history of allergies . Substances that don't bother most people (such as venom from bee stings and certain foods, medicines, and pollens) can trigger allergic reactions in certain people. First-time exposure may produce only a mild reaction. Repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions. Once a person has had an exposure or an allergic reaction (and thus is sensitized to an allergen), even a very limited exposure to a very small amount of allergen can trigger a severe reaction. Most severe allergic reactions occur within

There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. Treatment The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment

Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected or if it causes discomfort. DO NOT If a person is having an allergic reaction: Do not assume that any allergy shots the person has already received will provide complete protection. Do not place a pillow under the person's head if he or she is having trouble breathing. This can block the airways. Do not give the person anything by mouth if the person is having trouble breathing. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact for medical assistance (911 or the local emergency number) right away if: The person is having a severe allergic reaction. Do not wait to see if the reaction is getting worse. The person has a history of severe allergic reactions (check for a medical ID tag). Prevention To prevent allergic reactions: Avoid triggers such as foods and medicines that have caused an allergic reaction in the past. Ask detailed questions about ingredients when you are eating away from home. Carefully check ingredient labels. If you have a child who is allergic to certain foods, introduce one new food

see if you get better, or to use suspected items to see if you feel worse. This is called ""use or elimination testing."" This is often used to check for food or medicine allergies. Treatment Severe allergic reactions ( anaphylaxis ) need to be treated with a medicine called epinephrine. It can be life-saving when given right away. If you use epinephrine, call 911 or the local emergency number and go straight to the hospital. The best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This is especially important for food and medicine allergies. There are several types of medicines to prevent and treat allergies. Which medicine your provider recommends depends on the type and severity of your symptoms, your age, and overall health. Illnesses that are caused by allergies (such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema) may need other treatments. Medicines that can be used to treat allergies include: ANTIHISTAMINES Antihistamines are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are available in many forms, including: Capsules and pills Eye drops Injection Liquid Nasal spray CORTICOSTEROIDS These are anti-inflammatory medicines. They are available in many forms, including: Creams, lotions, and ointment for the skin Eye drops Nasal spray

may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, drug allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Outlook (Prognosis) Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or

food under medical supervision. This type of test may cause severe allergic reactions. Challenge testing should only be done by a trained provider. Never try to cause a reaction or reintroduce a food on your own. These tests should only be done under the guidance of a provider, especially if your first reaction was severe. Treatment If you suspect that you or your child has a food allergy, see an allergy specialist doctor (allergist). Treatment may involve any of the following: Avoiding the food (this is the most effective treatment). Desensitization, during which you eat a small amount of the food each day. This must be done under an allergist's guidance. Other treatments, including allergy shots and probiotics, have not been proven to help with food allergies. If your child has a problem with cow's milk formula, your provider may suggest trying a soy-based formula or something called an elemental formula, if it is available. If you have symptoms on only one area of the body, for example, a hive on the chin after eating the food, you may not need any treatment. The symptoms will likely go away in a brief time. Antihistamines may relieve the discomfort. Soothing skin

in your area. Outlook (Prognosis) Most allergies can be easily treated with medicine. Some children may outgrow an allergy, especially food allergies. But once a substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it usually continues to affect the person. Allergy shots are most effective when used to treat hay fever and insect sting allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of a severe reaction. Allergy shots may need years of treatment, but they work in most cases. However, they may cause uncomfortable side effects (such as hives and rash) and dangerous outcomes (such as anaphylaxis). Talk with your provider whether allergy drops (SLIT) are right for you. Treatments for food allergies are evolving quickly. Speak with your provider about different food allergy treatments available.

- liver disease Causes An important function of the liver is to make toxic substances in the body harmless. These substances may be made by the body (ammonia), or substances that you take in (medicines). When the liver is damaged, these ""poisons"" can build up in the bloodstream and affect the function of the nervous system. The result may be HE. HE can occur suddenly and you may become ill very quickly. Causes of HE may include: Hepatitis A or B infection (uncommon to occur this way) Blockage of blood supply to the liver Poisoning by different toxins or medicines Constipation Upper gastrointestinal bleeding People with severe liver damage often suffer from HE. The end result of chronic liver damage is cirrhosis. Common causes of chronic liver disease are: Severe hepatitis B or C infection Alcohol abuse Autoimmune hepatitis Bile duct disorders Some medicines Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Once you have liver damage, episodes of worsening brain function may be triggered by: Loss of body fluids (dehydration) Eating too much protein Low blood potassium or sodium levels Bleeding in the intestines, stomach, or food pipe (esophagus) Infections Kidney problems Low oxygen levels in the body","Limiting the amount of alcohol you drink will help prevent Alcoholic liver disease. It is also beneficial to talk openly to your provider about your alcohol intake, as they can counsel you about how much alcohol is safe for you.

Weakness can first affect the arms or legs, or the ability to breathe or swallow. As the disease gets worse, more muscle groups develop problems. ALS does not affect the senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch). Most people are able to think normally, although a small number develop dementia, causing problems with memory. Muscle weakness starts in one body part, such as the arm or hand, and slowly gets worse until it leads to the following: Difficulty lifting, climbing stairs, and walking Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing -- choking easily, drooling, or gagging Head drop due to weakness of the neck muscles Speech problems, such as a slow or abnormal speech pattern (slurring of words) Voice changes,

How can Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS be prevented?,"the disease is a risk factor for ALS. Other risks include military service. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have to do with environmental exposure to toxins. Symptoms Symptoms usually do not develop until after age 50, but they can start in younger people. People with ALS have a loss of muscle strength and coordination that eventually gets worse and makes it impossible for them to do routine tasks such as going up steps, getting out of a chair, or swallowing. Weakness can first affect the arms or legs, or the ability to breathe or swallow. As the disease gets worse, more muscle groups develop problems. ALS does not affect the senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch). Most people are able to think normally, although a small number develop dementia, causing problems with memory. Muscle weakness starts in one body part, such as the arm or hand, and slowly gets worse until it leads to the following: Difficulty lifting, climbing stairs, and walking Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing -- choking easily, drooling, or gagging Head drop due to weakness of the neck muscles Speech problems, such as a slow or abnormal speech pattern (slurring of words) Voice changes,

people live slightly longer: Riluzole (Rilutek) Edaravone (Radicava) Treatments to control other symptoms include: Baclofen or diazepam for spasticity that interferes with daily activities Trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline for people with problems swallowing their own saliva Trials of gene therapy are now underway for some specific hereditary causes. Physical therapy, rehabilitation, use of braces or a wheelchair, or other measures may be needed to help with muscle function and general health. Ongoing oversight by a physical medicine provider is helpful, given continuously changing symptoms. People with ALS tend to lose weight. The illness itself increases the need for food and calories. At the same time, problems with choking and swallowing make it hard to eat enough. To help with feeding, a tube may be placed into the stomach. A dietitian who specializes in ALS can give advice on healthy eating. Breathing devices include machines that are considered non-invasive (such as CPAP or BiPAP). Others require tube in the trachea (invasive ventilation). Medicine for depression may be needed if a person with ALS is diagnosed with depression. They also should discuss their wishes regarding artificial ventilation with their families and providers. Support Groups Emotional support is vital in coping with the disorder,

because mental functioning is not affected. Groups such as the ALS Association may be available to help people who are coping with the disorder. Support for people who are caring for someone with ALS is also available, and may be very helpful. Outlook (Prognosis) Over time, people with ALS lose the ability to function and care for themselves. Death often occurs within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis. About 1 in 4 people survive for more than 5 years after diagnosis. Some people live much longer, but they typically need help breathing from a ventilator or other device. Possible Complications Complications of ALS include: Breathing in food or fluid ( aspiration ) Loss of ability to care for self Lung failure Pneumonia Pressure sores Weight loss When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have symptoms of ALS, particularly if you have a family history of the disorder You or someone else has been diagnosed with ALS and symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop Increased difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and episodes of apnea are symptoms that require immediate attention. Prevention You may want to see a genetic counselor if you have a family history of ALS.

What are the symptoms of Angiodysplasia of the colon?,"seen on the right side of the colon. Most likely, the problem develops due to normal movement of the colon that causes the blood vessels in the area to enlarge. When this swelling becomes severe, a tiny passageway develops between a small artery and vein. This is called an arteriovenous malformation. Bleeding can occur from this area in the colon wall. Other causes include certain heart and lung conditions. Rarely, angiodysplasia of the colon is related to other diseases of the blood vessels. One of these is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The condition is not related to cancer. It is also different from diverticulosis, which is a more common cause of intestinal bleeding in older adults. Symptoms The symptoms vary. Older people may have symptoms such as: Weakness Fatigue Shortness of breath due to anemia They may not have noticeable bleeding directly from the colon. Other people may have bouts of mild or severe bleeding in which bright red or black blood comes from the rectum. There is no pain associated with angiodysplasia. Exams and Tests Tests that may be done to diagnose this condition include: Angiography 01_003327(only useful if there is active bleeding into the colon). CT angiography (CTA). This is

one or more of the following tests: Blood tests to see if you have an infection or have lost too much blood CT scan or ultrasound of the abdomen if you have bleeding, loose stools, or pain A colonoscopy is needed to make the diagnosis. A colonoscopy is an exam that views the inside of the colon and rectum. A small camera attached to a tube can reach the length of the colon. This test should not be done when you are having symptoms of acute diverticulitis. Angiography : Angiography is an imaging test that uses x-rays and a special dye to see inside the blood vessels. This test is done to determine a site of bleeding in the GI tract. It may be used if the area of bleeding is not seen during a colonoscopy. Treatment Because most people have no symptoms, most of the time, no treatment is needed. Your health care provider may recommend getting more fiber in your diet. A high-fiber diet has many health benefits. Most people don't get enough fiber. To help prevent constipation, you should: Eat plenty of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables.

Treatment EGD will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery may be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using: Open surgery , during which 1 or 2 larger incisions are made. Minimally invasive surgery , during which 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions. Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus. Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such

What are the symptoms of Allergic rhinitis?,"A blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies. Treatment LIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS The best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure . You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered. For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda. Treatments for allergic rhinitis include: ANTIHISTAMINES Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following: Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this

ground. Hay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies. Symptoms Symptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens. Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. If your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances.

seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours. Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes or hours of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition. Without treatment, anaphylaxis can get worse very quickly and lead to death within 15 minutes. Causes Common allergens include: Animal dander Bee stings or stings from other insects such as fire ants Foods, especially milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish Medicines Pollens Symptoms Common symptoms of a mild allergic reaction include: A few hives (especially over the neck and face) Itching Nasal congestion Rashes Watery, red eyes Symptoms of a moderate or severe reaction include: Abdominal pain Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Chest discomfort or tightness Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, wheezing Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Flushing or redness of the face Hives all over Nausea� or vomiting Palpitations Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness First Aid For a mild to moderate reaction: Calm and reassure the person having the reaction. Anxiety can make symptoms worse. Try to identify the allergen and have the person avoid further contact

people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause. Anaphylaxis is life threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction. Symptoms Symptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes. They may include any of the following: Abdominal pain Feeling anxious Chest discomfort or tightness Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, or high-pitched breathing sounds Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Hives , itchiness, redness of the skin Nasal congestion Nausea or vomiting Palpitations Slurred speech Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine the person and ask about what might have caused the condition. Tests for the allergen that caused anaphylaxis (if the cause is not obvious) may be done after treatment. Treatment Anaphylaxis is an emergency condition that needs medical attention right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately. Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR . Call 911 or

and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction. SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT) Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies. Outlook (Prognosis) Most symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots. Some people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger. But once a substance such as pollen causes allergies, it often continues to have a long-term effect on the person.

What is the treatment for Allergic rhinitis?,"A blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies. Treatment LIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS The best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure . You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered. For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda. Treatments for allergic rhinitis include: ANTIHISTAMINES Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following: Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this

type of medicine. Others cause little or no sleepiness. Antihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. Ask your provider if you should try these medicines first. Antihistamine eye drops can be used as needed for itchy, watery eyes. CORTICOSTEROIDS Nasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis. They work best when used nonstop, but they can also be helpful when used for shorter periods of time. They can even help when used intermittently. Corticosteroid sprays are generally safe for children and adults. Many brands are available without a prescription. For specific brands, you may need a prescription from your provider. DECONGESTANTS Decongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness. Do not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days. OTHER MEDICINES Leukotriene inhibitors are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms. These medicines can cause side effects such as anxiety or depression in some people. Speak with your provider before starting these medications if you have a history of mental health issues. ALLERGY SHOTS Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen

and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction. SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT) Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies. Outlook (Prognosis) Most symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots. Some people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger. But once a substance such as pollen causes allergies, it often continues to have a long-term effect on the person.

Symptoms include: Cough, often mild and dry Fever Rapid breathing Shortness of breath, especially with activity (exertion) Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. Tests that may be ordered include: Blood gases (both arterial and venous) Bronchoscopy (with lavage) Lung biopsy X-ray of the chest Sputum exam to check for fungus that causes the infection Complete blood count (CBC) Beta-1,3 glucan level in the blood and/or lavage fluid from bronchoscopy Treatment Anti-infection medicines can be given by mouth (orally) or through a vein ( intravenously ), depending on how severe the illness is. People with low oxygen levels and moderate to severe disease are often prescribed corticosteroids as well. Outlook (Prognosis) Pneumocystis pneumonia can be life threatening. It can cause respiratory failure that can lead to death. People with this condition need early and effective treatment. For moderate to severe pneumocystis pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS, the short term use of corticosteroids has decreased the incidence of death. Possible Complications Complications that may result include:

Treatment helps to manage health and development problems caused by the condition. Anticonvulsant medicines help control seizures Behavior therapy helps manage hyperactivity, sleep problems, and development problems Occupational and speech therapy manage speech problems and teach living skills Physical therapy helps with walking and movement problems Support Groups More information and support for people with Angelman syndrome and their families can be found at: Angelman Syndrome Foundation -- www.angelman.org AngelmanUK -- www.angelmanuk.org Outlook (Prognosis) People with AS live close to a normal lifespan. Many have friendships and interact socially. Treatment helps improve function. People with AS can't live on their own. However, they may be able to learn certain tasks and live with others in a supervised setting. Possible Complications Complications may

gene passed on from the mother is active. Angelman syndrome most often occurs because the UBE3A gene passed on from the mother doesn't work the way it should. In some cases, AS is caused when two copies of the UBE3A gene come from the father, and none come from the mother. This means neither gene is active, because they both come from the father. Symptoms In newborns and infants: Loss of muscle tone (floppiness) Trouble feeding Heartburn (acid reflux) Trembling arm and leg movements In toddlers and older children: Unstable or jerky walking Little or no speech Happy, excitable personality Laughing and smiling often Light hair, skin, and eye color compared to rest of family Small head size compared to body, flattened back of head Severe intellectual disability Seizures Excessive movement of the hands and limbs Sleep problems Tongue thrusting, drooling Unusual chewing and mouthing movements Crossed eyes Walking with arms uplifted and hands waving Most children with this disorder don't show symptoms until about 6 to 12 months.

If no periods have occurred when a girl is older than 15, further testing may be needed. The need is more urgent if she has gone through other normal changes that occur during puberty. Being born with incompletely formed genital or pelvic organs can lead to a lack of menstrual periods. Some of these defects include: Blockages or narrowing of the cervix Hymen that has no opening Missing uterus or vagina Vaginal septum (a wall that divides the vagina into 2 sections) Hormones play a big role in a woman's menstrual cycle. Hormone problems can occur when: Changes occur to the parts of the brain where hormones that help manage the menstrual cycle are produced. The ovaries are not working correctly. Either of these problems may be due to: Anorexia (loss of appetite) with low body mass index (BMI) Chronic or long-term illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis or heart disease Genetic defects or disorders Infections that occurred before or after the woman's birth Other birth defects Poor nutrition Tumors In many cases,

For example, the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy. Breastfeeding and menopause are also common, but natural causes. Women who take birth control pills or who receive hormone shots such as Depo-Provera may not have any monthly bleeding. When they stop taking these hormones, their periods may not return for more than 6 months.

If no periods have occurred when a girl is older than 15, further testing may be needed. The need is more urgent if she has gone through other normal changes that occur during puberty. Being born with incompletely formed genital or pelvic organs can lead to a lack of menstrual periods. Some of these defects include: Blockages or narrowing of the cervix Hymen that has no opening Missing uterus or vagina Vaginal septum (a wall that divides the vagina into 2 sections) Hormones play a big role in a woman's menstrual cycle. Hormone problems can occur when: Changes occur to the parts of the brain where hormones that help manage the menstrual cycle are produced. The ovaries are not working correctly. Either of these problems may be due to: Anorexia (loss of appetite) with low body mass index (BMI) Chronic or long-term illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis or heart disease Genetic defects or disorders Infections that occurred before or after the woman's birth Other birth defects Poor nutrition Tumors In many cases,

If the cause is� bulimia , anorexia or too much exercise, periods will often begin when the weight returns to normal or the exercise level is decreased. If the amenorrhea cannot be corrected, hormone medicines can sometimes be used. Medicines can help the woman feel more like her friends and female family members. They can also protect the bones from becoming too thin ( osteoporosis ).

If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies. Symptoms Symptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens. Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. If your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances.

may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems, eczema , and asthma , worse. Symptoms Mostly, the part of the body the allergen touches determines what symptoms you develop. For example: Allergens that you breathe in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, and wheezing . Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash , hives , itching, blisters, or skin peeling. Medicine allergies and food allergies may involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms. At times, an allergy can trigger a response that involves the entire body. Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions, such as when the allergy symptoms occur. Allergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual allergy or are caused by other problems. For example, eating contaminated food ( food poisoning ) may cause symptoms similar to food allergies. Some medicines (such as aspirin and ampicillin) can produce non-allergic reactions, including rashes. A runny nose or cough may actually be due to an infection. Skin testing is the

your eyes are exposed to allergy-causing substances, a substance called histamine is released by your body. The blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen. The eyes can become red, itchy , and teary very quickly. The pollens that cause symptoms vary from person to person and from area to area. Tiny, hard-to-see pollens that may cause allergic symptoms include grasses, ragweed and trees. These same pollens may also cause hay fever. Your symptoms may be worse when there is more pollen in the air. Higher levels of pollen are more likely on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground. Mold, animal dander, or dust mites may cause this problem also. Allergies tend to run in families. It is hard to know exactly how many people have allergies. Many conditions are often lumped under the term ""allergy"" even when they might not truly be an allergy. Symptoms Symptoms may be seasonal and can include: Intense itching or burning eyes Puffy eyelids, most often in the morning Red eyes Stringy eye discharge Tearing (watery eyes) Widened blood vessels in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye Exams and Tests Your health

seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours. Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes or hours of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition. Without treatment, anaphylaxis can get worse very quickly and lead to death within 15 minutes. Causes Common allergens include: Animal dander Bee stings or stings from other insects such as fire ants Foods, especially milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish Medicines Pollens Symptoms Common symptoms of a mild allergic reaction include: A few hives (especially over the neck and face) Itching Nasal congestion Rashes Watery, red eyes Symptoms of a moderate or severe reaction include: Abdominal pain Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Chest discomfort or tightness Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, wheezing Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Flushing or redness of the face Hives all over Nausea� or vomiting Palpitations Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness First Aid For a mild to moderate reaction: Calm and reassure the person having the reaction. Anxiety can make symptoms worse. Try to identify the allergen and have the person avoid further contact

sickness is a delayed type of reaction that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Drug allergies can also be associated with low blood counts. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat ( palpitations ) Exams and Tests An examination may show: Decreased blood pressure Hives Rash Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue ( angioedema ) Wheezing Skin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines. There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. Treatment The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction.

Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, drug allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Outlook (Prognosis) Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it.

Angioedema may occur alone or with other illnesses (including autoimmune disorders such as lupus,� leukemia , and lymphoma). A rare form of angioedema runs in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called hereditary angioedema . Symptoms The main symptom is sudden swelling below the skin surface. Welts or swelling on the surface of the skin can also develop. The swelling usually occurs around the eyes and lips. It may also be found on the hands, feet, and throat. The swelling may form a line or be more spread out. The welts are painful and may be itchy. This is known as hives (urticaria). They turn pale and swell if irritated. The deeper swelling of angioedema may also be painful. Other symptoms may include: Abdominal cramping Breathing difficulty Swollen eyes and mouth Swollen lining of the eyes ( chemosis ) Exams and Tests The health care provider will look at

your skin and ask if you have been exposed to any irritating substances. If your throat is affected, a physical exam might reveal abnormal sounds ( stridor ) when you breathe in. Blood tests or allergy testing may be ordered, but often no cause of the swelling or hives is found. Treatment Mild symptoms may not need treatment. Moderate to severe symptoms may need to be treated. Breathing difficulty is an emergency condition. People with angioedema should: Avoid any known allergen or trigger that causes their symptoms. Avoid any medicines, herbs, or supplements that are not prescribed by a provider. Cool compresses or soaks can relieve pain. Medicines used to treat angioedema include: Antihistamines Anti-inflammatory medicines (corticosteroids) Epinephrine injectors (people with a history of severe symptoms may need to carry these with them in case of a severe reaction) Inhaler medicines that help open up the airways If the person has trouble breathing, seek medical help right away. A severe, life-threatening airway blockage may occur if the throat swells. Outlook (Prognosis) Angioedema that does not affect the breathing may be uncomfortable.

What Abnormal Results Mean Low levels of C1-INH may cause certain types of angioedema. Angioedema results in sudden swelling of the tissues of the face, upper throat and tongue. It may also cause difficulty breathing. Swelling in the intestine and abdominal pain may also occur. There are two types of angioedema that result from decreased levels of C1-INH. Hereditary angioedema affects children and young adults under age 20. Acquired angioedema is seen in adults older than age 40. Adults with acquired angioedema are much more likely to also have other conditions, such as cancer or autoimmune disease. Risks Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names C1 inhibiting factor; C1-INH Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Edema Vascular Diseases Title: CA-125 blood test How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed.

seen on the right side of the colon. Most likely, the problem develops due to normal movement of the colon that causes the blood vessels in the area to enlarge. When this swelling becomes severe, a tiny passageway develops between a small artery and vein. This is called an arteriovenous malformation. Bleeding can occur from this area in the colon wall. Other causes include certain heart and lung conditions. Rarely, angiodysplasia of the colon is related to other diseases of the blood vessels. One of these is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The condition is not related to cancer. It is also different from diverticulosis, which is a more common cause of intestinal bleeding in older adults. Symptoms The symptoms vary. Older people may have symptoms such as: Weakness Fatigue Shortness of breath due to anemia They may not have noticeable bleeding directly from the colon. Other people may have bouts of mild or severe bleeding in which bright red or black blood comes from the rectum. There is no pain associated with angiodysplasia. Exams and Tests Tests that may be done to diagnose this condition include: Angiography 01_003327(only useful if there is active bleeding into the colon). CT angiography (CTA). This is

anemia do not have enough hemoglobin. The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to: Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines that affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example, celiac disease ) Poor diet Surgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines Possible causes of anemia include: Iron deficiency Vitamin B12 deficiency Folate deficiency Certain medicines Destruction of red blood cells earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems) Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, ulcerative colitis , or rheumatoid arthritis Some forms of anemia, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, which can be inherited Pregnancy Problems with bone marrow such as lymphoma, leukemia , myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma , or aplastic anemia Slow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers ) Sudden heavy blood loss Symptoms You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild or if the problem develops slowly.

year of life. Other symptoms can include: Bone deformities in the face Fatigue Growth failure Shortness of breath Yellow skin (jaundice) People with the minor form of alpha and beta thalassemia have small red blood cells but no symptoms. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do a physical exam to look for an enlarged spleen. A blood sample will be sent to a laboratory to be tested. Red blood cells will appear small and abnormally shaped when looked at under a microscope. A complete blood count (CBC) reveals anemia. A test called hemoglobin electrophoresis shows the presence of an abnormal form of hemoglobin and can detect beta thalassemia. A test called mutational analysis can help detect alpha thalassemia. Treatment Treatment for thalassemia major often involves regular blood transfusions and folate supplements. If you receive blood transfusions, you should not take iron supplements. Doing so can cause a high amount of iron to build up in the body, which can be harmful. People who receive a lot of blood transfusions need a treatment called chelation therapy. This is done to remove excess iron from the body. A bone marrow transplant may help treat the disease in some people, especially","Symptoms of Anemia of chronic disease may include:

What is the treatment for Anemia of chronic disease?,"as that caused by cancer or HIV/AIDS may require: Blood transfusion Erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, given as a shot Outlook (Prognosis) The anemia will improve when the disease that is causing it is treated. Possible Complications Discomfort from symptoms is the main complication in most cases. Anemia may lead to a higher risk for death in people with heart failure. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have a long-term (chronic) disorder and you develop symptoms of anemia. Alternative Names Anemia of inflammation; Inflammatory anemia; AOCD; ACD; Anemia of chronic inflammation Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Anemia Title: Anemia Causes Although many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with

Fanconi anemia.) People who have had a successful bone marrow transplant still need regular check-ups because of the risk for additional cancers. Hormone therapy combined with low doses of steroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) is prescribed to those who do not have a bone marrow donor. Most people respond to hormone therapy. But everyone with the disorder will quickly get worse when the medicines are stopped. In most cases, these medicines eventually stop working. Additional treatments may include: Antibiotics (possibly given through a vein) to treat infections Blood transfusions to treat symptoms due to low blood counts Human papilloma virus and other vaccines Most people with this condition visit a doctor on regular basis, specializing in treating: Blood disorders (hematologist) Diseases related to glands (endocrinologist) Eye diseases (ophthalmologist) Bone diseases (orthopedist) Kidney disease (nephrologist) Diseases related to female reproductive organs and breasts (gynecologist) Outlook (Prognosis) The survival rates vary from person to person. The outlook is poor in those with low blood counts. New and improved treatments, such as bone marrow transplants, have likely improved survival. People with Fanconi anemia are more likely to develop several types of blood disorders and cancers. These may include leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome ,

spleen (splenectomy) may be considered. You may receive treatment to suppress your immune system if you do not respond to steroids. Medicines such as azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and rituximab (Rituxan) have been used. Blood transfusions are given with caution, because the blood may not be compatible and it may cause more red blood cell destruction. Outlook (Prognosis) The disease may start quickly and be very serious, or it may stay mild and not need special treatment. In most people, steroids or splenectomy can totally or partially control anemia. Possible Complications Severe anemia rarely leads to death. Severe infection may occur as a complication of treatment with steroids, other medicines that suppress the immune system, or splenectomy. These treatments impair the body's ability to fight infection.

An IDM has a higher risk of birth defects if the mother has pre-existing diabetes that is not well controlled from the very beginning. Symptoms The infant is often larger than usual for babies born after the same length of time in the mother's womb (large for gestational age). In some cases, especially if mothers have more longstanding illness, the baby may be smaller (small for gestational age). Other symptoms may include: Blue skin color, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing (signs of immature lungs or heart failure) Poor sucking, lethargy, weak cry Seizures (sign of severe low blood sugar) Poor feeding Puffy face Tremors or shaking shortly after birth Jaundice (yellow skin color) Exams and Tests Before the baby is born: Ultrasound in the last few months of pregnancy can monitor the size of the baby.

The placenta carries blood to a baby still growing in the womb. Damage to the placenta can prevent normal growth and development. Damage to the amnion may produce fiber-like bands that can trap, compress, or amputate parts of the developing baby. These bands reduce blood supply to the areas and cause them to develop abnormally. However, some cases of ABS deformity may be caused by reduced blood supply without any signs of bands or damage to the amnion. There have also been rare cases that seem to be due to genetic defects. Symptoms The severity of the deformity can vary widely, from a small dent in a toe or finger to an entire body part missing or being severely underdeveloped.

Title: Amniocentesis How the Test is Performed Amniocentesis removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby in the womb (uterus). It is most often done in a doctor's office or medical center. You do not need to stay in the hospital. You will have a pregnancy ultrasound first. This helps your health care provider see where the baby is in your womb. Numbing medicine is then rubbed onto part of your belly. Sometimes, the medicine is given through a shot in the skin on the belly area. The skin is cleaned with a disinfecting liquid. Your provider inserts a long, thin needle through your belly and into your womb. A small amount of fluid (about 4 teaspoons or 20 milliliters) is removed from the sac surrounding the baby. In most cases, the baby is watched by ultrasound during the procedure. The fluid is sent to a laboratory. Testing may include: Genetic studies Measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (a substance produced in the liver of the developing baby) Culture for infection Results of genetic testing usually take about 2 weeks. Other test results come back in 1 to 3 days. Sometimes amniocentesis is also used later in

Surgery to place a tube in the throat to help with breathing (tracheostomy ) or in the stomach to help with eating (gastrostomy) may be needed during treatment. For some people, enrolling in a clinical trial of new thyroid cancer treatments based on the genetic changes in the tumor may be an option. The presence of a mutation in the BRAF gene is treatable with targeted medicines and may improve outcomes. Support Groups You can often ease the stress of illness by joining a support group of people sharing common experiences and problems. Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook with this disease is poor.

It occurs most often in people over age 60. It is more common in females than in males. The cause is unknown. Anaplastic cancer accounts for only about less than 1% of all thyroid cancers in the United States. Symptoms Symptoms include: Cough Coughing up blood Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness or changing voice Loud breathing Lower neck lump, which often grows quickly Pain in the neck Vocal cord paralysis Overactive thyroid ( hyperthyroidism ) Exams and Tests A physical exam almost always shows a growth in the neck region. Other exams may include: An MRI or CT scan of the neck may show a tumor growing from the thyroid gland. A thyroid biopsy makes the diagnosis. The tumor tissue can be checked for genetic markers that may suggest targets for

Procedure is Performed Radioiodine therapy is used to treat hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer . Hyperthyroidism occurs when your thyroid gland makes excess thyroid hormones. Radioiodine treats this condition by killing overactive thyroid cells and by shrinking an enlarged thyroid gland. This stops the thyroid gland from producing too much thyroid hormone. The nuclear medicine team will try to calculate a dose that leaves you with normal thyroid function. But, this calculation is not always completely accurate. As a result, the treatment can lead to hypothyroidism , which needs to be treated with thyroid hormone supplementation. Radioactive iodine treatment is also used in the treatment of some thyroid cancers after surgery has already removed the cancer and most of the thyroid gland. The radioactive iodine kills any remaining thyroid cancer cells that might remain after surgery. You may receive this treatment 3 to 6 weeks after the surgery to remove your thyroid. It also can kill cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of your body. Many thyroid experts now believe this treatment has been overused in some people with thyroid cancer because we now know that some people have a very low risk for cancer recurrence. Talk to

Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and medical history. A physical examination may show: Enlarged thyroid gland that is not painful to the touch Rapid heart rate Shaking hands ( tremor ) Brisk reflexes Sweaty, warm skin Tests that may be done include: Radioactive iodine uptake Thyroid hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine) TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) C-reactive protein (CRP) Many providers now screen for thyroid disease before and after starting medicines that commonly cause this condition. Treatment Treatment is based on symptoms. Medicines called beta-blockers may be used to relieve rapid heart rate and excessive sweating. Outlook (Prognosis) Silent thyroiditis often goes away on its own within 1 year. The acute phase usually ends within 3 months. Some people develop hypothyroidism over time. They need to be treated with a medicine that replaces thyroid hormone. Regular follow-ups with a provider are recommended. The disease is not infectious. People cannot catch the disease from you. It also is not inherited within families like some other thyroid conditions. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have symptoms of this condition.

The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells. A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause of this type of anemia in children. When a child is growing rapidly, such as during puberty, even more iron is needed. Toddlers who drink too much","The treatment for Anaplastic thyroid cancer typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. However, surgery alone cannot cure this type of cancer. Since it grows and spreads rapidly, early detection and aggressive treatment are crucial.

Enrolling in a clinical trial for new thyroid cancer treatments might be an option, especially if the tumor has genetic changes such as a mutation in the BRAF gene, which can be treated with targeted medicines and may improve outcomes.

Support groups can also help ease the stress of the illness by providing a platform for people sharing common experiences and problems.

Remember, it is essential to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.","The treatment for Anaplastic thyroid cancer typically involves a combination of approaches, as surgery alone cannot cure it. Here are the main treatment options:

the disease is a risk factor for ALS. Other risks include military service. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have to do with environmental exposure to toxins. Symptoms Symptoms usually do not develop until after age 50, but they can start in younger people. People with ALS have a loss of muscle strength and coordination that eventually gets worse and makes it impossible for them to do routine tasks such as going up steps, getting out of a chair, or swallowing. Weakness can first affect the arms or legs, or the ability to breathe or swallow. As the disease gets worse, more muscle groups develop problems. ALS does not affect the senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch). Most people are able to think normally, although a small number develop dementia, causing problems with memory. Muscle weakness starts in one body part, such as the arm or hand, and slowly gets worse until it leads to the following: Difficulty lifting, climbing stairs, and walking Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing -- choking easily, drooling, or gagging Head drop due to weakness of the neck muscles Speech problems, such as a slow or abnormal speech pattern (slurring of words) Voice changes,

MSA-C tend to start at a younger age in people with the inherited form. The main symptom is clumsiness ( ataxia ) that slowly gets worse. There may also be problems with balance, slurring of speech, and difficulty walking. Other symptoms may include: Abnormal eye movements Abnormal movements Abnormal sweating Bowel or bladder problems Difficulty swallowing Cold hands and feet Lightheadedness when standing Headache while standing that is relieved by lying down Muscle stiffness or rigidity, spasms, tremor Nerve damage (neuropathy) Problems in speaking and sleeping due to spasms of the vocal cords Sexual function problems Exams and Tests A thorough medical and nervous system examination, as well as a symptom review and family history are needed to make the diagnosis. There are genetic tests to look for the causes of some forms of the disorder. But, no specific test is available in many cases. An MRI of the brain may show changes in the size of affected brain structures, especially as the disease gets worse. But it is possible to have the disorder and have a normal MRI. Other tests such as positron emission tomography (PET) may be done to rule out other conditions. These may include swallowing studies

Shunt placement or complications Surgery Narcotic pain or sedative medicines Disorders that can appear similar to HE may include: Alcohol intoxication Alcohol withdrawal Bleeding inside the skull ( subdural hematoma ) Brain disorder caused by lack of vitamin B1 ( Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome ) In some cases, HE is a short-term problem that can be corrected. It may also occur as part of a long-term (chronic) problem from liver disease that gets worse over time. Symptoms Symptoms of HE are graded on a scale of grades 1 to 4. They may begin slowly and worsen over time. Early symptoms may be mild and include: Breath with a musty or sweet odor Changes in sleep patterns Changes in thinking Mild confusion Forgetfulness Personality or mood changes Poor concentration and judgment Worsening of handwriting or loss of other small hand movements Severe symptoms may include: Abnormal movements or shaking of hands or arms Agitation, excitement, or seizures (occur rarely) Disorientation Drowsiness or confusion Behavior or personality changes Slurred speech Slowed or sluggish movement People with HE can become unconscious, unresponsive, and possibly enter into a coma.

Physical therapy, rehabilitation, use of braces or a wheelchair, or other measures may be needed to help with muscle function and general health. Ongoing oversight by a physical medicine provider is helpful, given continuously changing symptoms. People with ALS tend to lose weight. The illness itself increases the need for food and calories. At the same time, problems with choking and swallowing make it hard to eat enough. To help with feeding, a tube may be placed into the stomach. A dietitian who specializes in ALS can give advice on healthy eating. Breathing devices include machines that are considered non-invasive (such as CPAP or BiPAP). Others require tube in the trachea (invasive ventilation). Medicine for depression may be needed if a person with ALS is diagnosed with depression.

A biopsy of the affected tissue confirms the disorder.� A biopsy of lymph nodes or other organs can show findings to support the diagnosis and to exclude other conditions. Sometimes a nerve or brain biopsy is needed. Treatment There is no known cure for sarcoidosis. Treatment is given if symptoms are severe or are getting worse. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms. Corticosteroids such as prednisone are prescribed to reduce inflammation. They are often prescribed until symptoms get better or go away. You may need to take the medicines for months, or even years. Other medicines may include hormone replacement and medicines that suppress the immune system. If you have numbness, weakness, vision or hearing problems, or other problems due to damage of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, you may need physical therapy, braces, a cane, walker, or wheelchair.

This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason. A brain aneurysm may begin to leak a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe headache that a person may describe as ""the worst headache of my life."" It may be called a thunderclap or sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a future rupture that may occur days to weeks after the headache first started. Symptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain. Symptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm, whether it breaks open, and what part of the brain it is pushing on. Symptoms may include: Double vision Loss of vision Headaches Eye pain Neck pain Stiff neck Ringing in the ears A sudden, severe headache is one symptom of an

aneurysm that has ruptured. Other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture may include: Confusion, no energy , sleepiness , or� stupor Eyelid drooping Headaches with nausea or vomiting Muscle weakness or difficulty moving any part of the body Numbness or decreased sensation in any part of the body Problems speaking Seizures Stiff neck (occasionally) Vision changes (double vision, loss of vision) Loss of consciousness ( coma ) NOTE: A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. Call 911 or the local emergency number. Exams and Tests An eye exam may show signs of increased pressure in the brain, including swelling of the optic nerve or bleeding into the retina of the eye. A clinical exam may show abnormal eye movement, speech, strength, or sensation. The following tests may be used to diagnose an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm and determine the cause of bleeding in the brain: Cerebral angiography or spiral CT angiogram (CTA) of the head to show the location and size of the aneurysm Spinal tap CT scan of the head Electrocardiogram (ECG) MRI of the head or MRI angiogram (MRA) Treatment Two common methods are used to repair a brain aneurysm .

If the aneurysm occurs near the body's surface, pain and swelling with a throbbing lump is often seen. Aneurysms in the body or brain often cause no symptoms. Aneurysms in the brain may expand without breaking open (rupturing). The expanded aneurysm may press on nerves and cause double vision, dizziness, or headaches. Some aneurysms may cause ringing in the ears. If an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur. When a brain aneurysm ruptures, there is a sudden severe headache that some people say is the ""worst headache of my life."" The risk of neurologic injury, coma , or death after a rupture is high.

What is the treatment for Aneurysm in the brain?,". Endovascular repair is most often done. It usually involves placing a very small coil and possibly a stent (called coiling and stenting) into or around the aneurysm. This is a less invasive and most common way to treat aneurysms. Not all aneurysms need to be treated right away. Those that are very small (less than 3 mm or 0.12 in) are less likely to break open. Your health care provider will help you decide whether or not it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can break open. Sometimes people are too ill to have surgery, or it may be too dangerous to treat the aneurysm because of its location. A ruptured aneurysm is an emergency that needs to be treated right away. Treatment may involve: Being admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) Complete bed rest and activity restrictions Drainage of blood from the brain area (cerebral ventricular drainage) Medicines to prevent seizures Medicines to control headaches and blood pressure Medicines to prevent vasospasm, which is a constriction of the arteries of your brain, leading to decreased blood flow Once the aneurysm is repaired, treatment may be needed to prevent a stroke

Endovascular repair (surgery), most often using a coil or coiling and stenting (mesh tubes), is a less invasive and more common way to treat aneurysms. During aneurysm clipping: You are given general anesthesia and a breathing tube. Your scalp, skull, and the coverings of the brain are opened. Your brain is gently retracted to reach the aneurysm. A metal clip is placed at the base (neck) of the aneurysm

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests used to diagnose an aneurysm include: CT scan CT angiogram MRI MRA ( magnetic resonance angiogram ) Ultrasound Angiogram Treatment Treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm. Your provider may only recommend regular checkups to see if the aneurysm is growing. Surgery may be done. The type of surgery that is done and when you need it depend on your symptoms and the size and type of aneurysm. Surgery may involve a large (open) surgical cut. Many times, a procedure called endovascular embolization is done. Coils or stents of metal are inserted into a brain aneurysm to make the aneurysm clot. This reduces the risk for rupture while keeping the artery open. Other brain aneurysms may need to have a clip placed on them to close them off and prevent a rupture. Aneurysms of the aorta may be reinforced with surgery to strengthen the blood vessel wall.

done through the radial artery in the wrist A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is passed through the open skin and into the artery. Dye is injected through this tube so that the blood vessel can be seen on x-ray images. The doctor gently moves the catheter through the blood vessel up to the area being treated. Once the catheter is in place, the doctor places small plastic particles, glue, metal coils, foam, or a balloon through it to seal off the faulty blood vessel. (If coils are used, it is called coil embolization.) This procedure can take several hours. Why the Procedure is Performed The procedure is most often used to treat aneurysms in the brain. It can also be used for other medical conditions when open surgery might be risky. The goal of the treatment is to prevent bleeding in the problem area and to reduce the risk that the blood vessel feeding it will break open (rupture). Your doctor will help you decide whether it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can rupture. This procedure may be used to treat: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) Brain aneurysm Carotid artery cavernous fistula (a","Treatment for an aneurysm in the brain depends on the size and location of the aneurysm, as well as the patient's overall health. The two common methods used to repair aneurysms are clipping, which is done during an open craniotomy, and endovascular repair, most often using a coil or coiling and stenting (mesh tubes). Endovascular repair is a less invasive and more common way to treat aneurysms. During endovascular repair, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is passed through an artery, usually in the wrist, and used to place small plastic particles, glue, metal coils, foam, or","The treatment for an aneurysm in the brain depends on its size and location. Here are some options:

1. **Regular Checkups**: If the aneurysm is small (less than 3 mm or 0.12 in), your provider may just monitor it to see if it's growing.

2. **Surgery**:
   - **Endovascular Repair ( Coiling and Stenting)**: This is the most common and less invasive way to treat aneurysms. It involves placing a small coil and possibly a stent into or around the aneurysm to prevent it from breaking open.
   - **Clipping**: During an open craniotomy, a metal clip is placed at the base of the aneurysm.

3. **Medications**: If the aneurysm has ruptured, treatment may involve medicines to prevent seizures, control headaches and blood pressure, and prevent vasospasm (narrowing of the arteries in the brain).

4. **Other Procedures**: In case of a ruptured aneurysm, treatments may include complete bed rest, drainage of blood from the brain area, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

After treatment, regular follow-ups are needed to ensure the aneurysm does not grow back. The goal of treatment is to prevent the aneurysm from breaking open and causing bleeding in the brain.",0.7626826167106628,0.24054982817869414,0.8307136297225952,0.4246575342465753,0.6264520840546519
How can Aneurysm in the brain be prevented?,". Endovascular repair is most often done. It usually involves placing a very small coil and possibly a stent (called coiling and stenting) into or around the aneurysm. This is a less invasive and most common way to treat aneurysms. Not all aneurysms need to be treated right away. Those that are very small (less than 3 mm or 0.12 in) are less likely to break open. Your health care provider will help you decide whether or not it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can break open. Sometimes people are too ill to have surgery, or it may be too dangerous to treat the aneurysm because of its location. A ruptured aneurysm is an emergency that needs to be treated right away. Treatment may involve: Being admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) Complete bed rest and activity restrictions Drainage of blood from the brain area (cerebral ventricular drainage) Medicines to prevent seizures Medicines to control headaches and blood pressure Medicines to prevent vasospasm, which is a constriction of the arteries of your brain, leading to decreased blood flow Once the aneurysm is repaired, treatment may be needed to prevent a stroke

aneurysm from forming. Treating high blood pressure may reduce the chance that an existing aneurysm will rupture. Controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis may reduce the likelihood of some types of aneurysms. People who are known to have an aneurysm may need regular visits with their provider to make sure the aneurysm is not changing size or shape. If unruptured aneurysms are discovered in time, they can be treated before causing problems or monitored with regular imaging (usually yearly). The decision to repair an unruptured cerebral aneurysm is based on the size and location of the aneurysm, and the person's age and general health.

If there is a high level of acetaminophen in the blood, the person will be given N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) as soon as possible. This medicine is called an antidote. It counteracts the effects of the acetaminophen. Without it, deadly liver failure may occur. Several doses may be required until the blood level drops to a safer value. If there are signs of a severe opioid overdose, the antidote naloxone will be given. Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does, depends on the amount of medicine swallowed and how quickly the treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. If breathing has been depressed for a long period before treatment, brain injury may occur.

Many factors can lead to attacks. Symptoms may include: Pain in the abdomen (belly area) and cramping. A gurgling or splashing sound heard over the intestine. Blood and possibly pus in the stools. Diarrhea, from only a few episodes to very often. Fever. Feeling that you need to pass stools, even though your bowels are already empty (tenesmus). It may involve straining, pain, and cramping. Weight loss. Children's growth may slow. Other symptoms that may occur with ulcerative colitis include the following: Eye irritation Joint pain and swelling Nausea and vomiting Skin lumps or ulcers Exams and Tests Colonoscopy with biopsy is most often used to diagnose ulcerative colitis. Colonoscopy is also used to screen people with ulcerative colitis for colon cancer .

to 3 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria. This time is called the incubation period. Most people have no symptoms. Others may have moderate symptoms similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may last for several weeks. Common symptoms may include: Dry cough (nonproductive) Fever Headache Joint pain (arthralgia) Muscle pains Other symptoms that may develop include: Abdominal pain Chest pain Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) Rash Exams and Tests A physical exam may reveal abnormal sounds (crackles) in the lungs or an enlarged liver or spleen. In the late stages of the disease, a heart murmur may be heard. Tests that may be done include: A chest x-ray to detect pneumonia or other changes in the lungs Blood tests to check for antibodies to Coxiella burnetti Liver function test Complete blood count (CBC) with differential Tissue staining of infected tissues to identify the bacteria Electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram (echo) to look at the heart for damage caused by the Coxiella burnetti bacteria Treatment Treatment with antibiotics can shorten the length of the illness.

If massive bleeding occurs, a person may need to be put on a ventilator to protect their airway and prevent blood from going down into the lungs. To stop the bleeding, the provider may pass an endoscope (tube with a small light at the end) into the esophagus: A clotting medicine may be injected into the varices. A rubber band may be placed around the bleeding varices (called banding or band ligation). Banding is the most common endoscopic treatment for esophageal varices. Other treatments to stop the bleeding: A medicine to tighten blood vessels may be given through a vein. Examples include octreotide or vasopressin . Rarely, a tube may be inserted through the nose into the stomach and inflated with air. This produces pressure against the bleeding veins (balloon tamponade). Once the bleeding is stopped, other varices can be treated with medicines and medical procedures to prevent future bleeding. These include: Drugs called beta blockers, such as propranolol, nadolol, and carvedilol that reduce portal vein pressure and the risk of bleeding. A rubber band can be placed around the varices during an EGD procedure. Also, some medicines can be injected","Bowlegs cannot be prevented, other than to avoid rickets.

What are the symptoms of Bruise?,"fever; Malta fever; Mediterranean fever Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Animal Diseases and Your Health Bacterial Infections Title: Bruise Considerations There are three types of bruises: Subcutaneous -- beneath the skin Intramuscular -- within the belly of the underlying muscle Periosteal -- bone bruise Bruises can last from days to months. A bone bruise is the most severe and painful. Causes Bruises are often caused by falls, sports injuries, car accidents, or blows received from other people or objects. If you take a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), or clopidogrel (Plavix), you are likely to bruise more easily. Symptoms Main symptoms are pain, swelling, and skin discoloration. The bruise begins as a pinkish red color that can be very tender to touch. It is often difficult to use the muscle that has been bruised. For example, a deep thigh bruise is painful when you walk or run. Eventually, the bruise changes to a bluish color, then greenish-yellow, and finally returns to the normal skin color as it heals. First Aid Place ice on the bruise to help it heal faster and to reduce swelling. Wrap the ice in a clean towel. Do

any injury, fall, or other reason. There are signs of infection around the bruised area including streaks of redness, pus or other drainage, or fever. Prevention Because bruises are usually the direct result of an injury, the following are important safety recommendations: Teach children how to be safe. Be mindful to avoid falls around the house. For example, be careful when climbing on ladders or other objects. Avoid standing or kneeling on counter tops. Wear seat belts in motor vehicles. Wear proper sports equipment to pad those areas most frequently bruised, such as thigh pads, hip guards, and elbow pads in football and hockey.

In the rare case of compartment syndrome , surgery is often done to relieve the extreme buildup of pressure. Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure on the soft tissues and structures beneath the skin. It can decrease the supply of blood and oxygen to the tissues.

A bone bruise is the most severe and painful. Causes Bruises are often caused by falls, sports injuries, car accidents, or blows received from other people or objects. If you take a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), or clopidogrel (Plavix), you are likely to bruise more easily. Symptoms Main symptoms are pain, swelling, and skin discoloration. The bruise begins as a pinkish red color that can be very tender to touch. It is often difficult to use the muscle that has been bruised. For example, a deep thigh bruise is painful when you walk or run. Eventually, the bruise changes to a bluish color, then greenish-yellow, and finally returns to the normal skin color as it heals. First Aid Place ice on the bruise to help it heal faster and to reduce swelling. Wrap the ice in a clean towel. Do

What is the treatment for Bicuspid aortic valve?,"if complications are severe. A narrowed valve can also be opened through cardiac catheterization. A fine tube (catheter) is directed to the heart and into the narrow opening of the aortic valve. A balloon attached to the end of the tube is inflated to make the opening of the valve larger. In adults, when a bicuspid valve becomes very leaky or very narrowed, it may need to be replaced. This used to be possible only with open heart surgery, but can now sometimes be done via catheters. Sometimes the aorta may also need to be repaired if it has become too wide or is too narrow. Medicine may be needed to relieve symptoms or prevent complications. Medicines may include: Medicines that lower the workload on the heart (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors) Medicines that make the heart muscle pump harder (inotropic agents) Water pills (diuretics) Outlook (Prognosis) How well the person does depends on the presence and severity of complications of BAV. The presence of other physical problems at birth also can affect how well a person does. Most babies with this condition have no symptoms, and the problem is not diagnosed until they are adults.

The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart valve. However, antibiotics are now used much less often. Ask your provider whether you need to use antibiotics. Some people may need heart surgery or procedures to treat mitral stenosis. These include: Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (also called valvuloplasty ). During this procedure, a tube (catheter) is inserted into a vein, usually in the leg. It is threaded up into the heart. A balloon on the tip of the catheter is inflated, widening the mitral valve and improving blood flow. This procedure may be tried instead of surgery in people with a less damaged mitral valve (especially if the valve does not leak very much). Even when successful, the procedure may need to be repeated months or years later. Surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve. Replacement valves can be made from different materials.

These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological -- made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 12 to 15 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life. In some cases, surgeons can use your own pulmonic valve to replace the damaged aortic valve. The pulmonic valve is then replaced with an artificial valve (this is called the Ross Procedure). This procedure may be useful for people who do not want to take blood thinners for the rest of their life. However, the new aortic valve does not last very long and may need to be replaced again by either a mechanical or a biologic valve.

You are connected to a heart-lung bypass machine. Your heart is stopped while you are connected to this machine. This machine does the work of your heart, providing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. Minimally invasive valve surgery is done through much smaller cuts than open surgery, or through a catheter inserted through the skin. Several different techniques are used: Percutaneous surgery (through the skin) Robot-assisted surgery If your surgeon can repair your mitral valve, you may have: Ring annuloplasty. The surgeon repairs the ring-like part around the valve by sewing a ring of plastic, cloth, or tissue around the valve. Valve repair. The surgeon trims, shapes, or rebuilds one or more of the leaflets of the valve. The leaflets are flaps that open and close the valve. Valve repair is best for the mitral and tricuspid valves.

Where Found Black widow spiders are found throughout the United States, mostly in the South and West. They are usually found in barns, sheds, stone walls, fences, woodpiles, porch furniture, and other outdoor structures. They are usually, but not always, found near ground level, or within a few feet of the ground. They make irregular, asymmetrical, ""disorganized"" looking webs. This genus of spider species is found worldwide. They are most plentiful in temperate and subtropical climates, especially during the summer months, and are common throughout the southern United States.

Black widow spider bites are very toxic. Seek medical help right away. Call the Poison Control Center for guidance. Follow these steps until medical help is given: Clean the area with soap and water. Wrap ice in a clean cloth and place it on the bite area. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has blood flow problems, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage. Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading.

Symptoms When the spider bites you, you may feel a sharp sting or nothing at all. Pain usually develops within the first several hours after being bitten, and may become severe. Children may have more serious reactions. Symptoms may include: Chills Itching General ill-feeling or discomfort Fever Nausea Reddish or purplish color in a circle around bite Sweating Large sore (ulcer) in the area of the bite Rarely, these symptoms may occur: Coma (lack of responsiveness) Blood in urine Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Kidney failure Seizures In serious cases, blood supply is cut off from the area of the bite. This results in black tissue scarring (eschar) at the site. The eschar sloughs off after about 2 to 5 weeks, leaving an ulcer through skin and fatty tissue. The ulcer may take many months to heal and leave a deep scar. Home Care Seek emergency medical treatment right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number, or poison control.

What are the symptoms of Brain tumor - children?,"depends on many things, including the type of tumor. In general, about 3 out of 4 children survive at least 5 years after being diagnosed. Long-term brain and nervous system problems may result from the tumor itself or from treatment. Children may have problems with attention, focus, or memory. They may also have problems processing information, planning, insight, or initiative or desire to do things. Children younger than age 7, especially younger than age 3, seem to be at greatest risk of these complications. Parents need to make sure that children receive support services at home and at school. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact a provider if a child develops headaches that do not go away or other symptoms of a brain tumor. Go to the emergency room if a child develops any of the following: Physical weakness Change in behavior Severe headache of unknown cause Seizure of unknown cause Vision changes Speech changes Alternative Names Glioblastoma multiforme - children; Ependymoma - children; Glioma - children; Astrocytoma - children; Medulloblastoma - children; Neuroglioma - children; Oligodendroglioma - children; Meningioma - children; Cancer - brain tumor (children) Patient Instructions Brain radiation - discharge Brain surgery - discharge Chemotherapy -

10. Ependymomas are a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign or malignant. Therapy to control the tumor is based on the location and type of ependymoma. Brainstem gliomas are very rare tumors that occur almost only in children. The average age at which they develop in children is about age 6. Symptoms Symptoms may be subtle and slowly become worse, or they may occur very quickly. Headaches are often the most common symptom. But only very rarely do children with headaches have a tumor. Headache patterns that may occur with brain tumors include: Headaches that are worse when waking up in the morning and go away within a few hours Headaches that get worse with coughing or exercise, or with a change in body position Headaches that occur while sleeping and with at least one other symptom such as vomiting or confusion Sometimes, the only symptoms of brain tumors are mental changes, which may include: Changes in personality and behavior Unable to concentrate Increased sleep Memory loss Problems with reasoning Other possible symptoms are: Seizures Unexplained frequent vomiting Gradual loss of movement or feeling in an arm or leg Hearing loss with or without dizziness Speech difficulty

Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Decreased coordination , clumsiness, falls General ill feeling or fatigue Headache , new or more severe than usual Memory loss, poor judgment, difficulty solving problems Numbness, tingling, pain, and other changes in sensation Personality changes Rapid emotional changes or strange behaviors Seizures that are new Problems with speech Vision changes , double vision, decreased vision Vomiting, with or without nausea Weakness of a body area Specific symptoms vary. Common symptoms of most types of metastatic brain tumors are caused by increased pressure in the brain. Exams and Tests An exam can show brain and nervous system changes based on where the tumor is in the brain. Signs of increased pressure in the skull are also common. Some tumors may not show signs until they are very large. Then, they can cause a very quick decline in nervous system function. The original (primary) tumor may be found by examining tumor tissues from the brain. Tests may include: Mammogram , CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to find the

What is the treatment for Brain tumor - children?,"for certain tumors. The following are treatments for specific types of tumors: Astrocytoma: Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be needed. Brainstem gliomas: Surgery may not be possible because of the tumor's location deep in the brain. Radiation is used to shrink the tumor and prolong life. Sometimes targeted chemotherapy can be used. Ependymomas: Treatment includes surgery. Radiation and chemotherapy may be necessary. Medulloblastomas: Surgery alone does not cure this type of tumor. Chemotherapy with or without radiation is often used in combination with surgery. Medicines used to treat children with primary brain tumors include: Corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling Diuretics (water pills) to reduce brain swelling and pressure Anticonvulsants to reduce or prevent seizures Pain medicines Chemotherapy to help shrink the tumor or prevent the tumor from growing back Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other such steps may be required to improve quality of life.

Surgery is often needed for most primary brain tumors. Some tumors may be completely removed. Those that are deep inside the brain or that enter brain tissue may be debulked instead of removed. Debulking is a procedure to reduce the tumor's size. Tumors can be hard to remove completely by surgery alone. This is because the tumor invades surrounding brain tissue much like roots from a plant spread through soil. When the tumor cannot be removed, surgery may still help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms. Radiation therapy is used for certain tumors. Chemotherapy may be used with surgery or radiation treatment. Other medicines used to treat primary brain tumors may include: Medicines to reduce brain swelling and pressure Anticonvulsants to reduce seizures Pain medicines Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, and occupational therapy may be needed to improve quality of life.

If you have trouble asking questions after hearing about your diagnosis, the person you bring with you can ask them for you. Treatment Treatment varies, based on the type of cancer and its stage. The stage of a cancer refers to how much it has grown and whether the tumor has spread from its original location. If the cancer is in one location and has not spread, the most common treatment approach is surgery to cure the cancer. This is often the case with skin cancers, as well as cancers of the lung, breast, and colon. If the tumor has spread to local lymph nodes only, sometimes these can also be removed with the tumor. If surgery cannot remove all of the cancer, the options for treatment may include radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , targeted cancer therapies , or other types of treatment. Some cancers require a combination of treatments. Lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph glands, is rarely treated with surgery. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and other nonsurgical therapies are often used. Although treatment for cancer can be difficult, there are many ways to keep up your strength.

After your tooth has been replanted, you will most likely need a root canal to remove the cut nerve that is inside your tooth. You may not need an emergency visit for a simple chip or a broken tooth that is not causing you discomfort. You should still have the tooth fixed to avoid sharp edges that can cut your lips or tongue. DO NOT If a tooth breaks or is knocked out: Do not handle the roots of the tooth. Handle only the chewing edge -- the crown (top) portion of the tooth. Do not scrape or wipe the root of the tooth to remove dirt. Do not brush or clean the tooth with alcohol or peroxide. Do not let the tooth dry out. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your dentist right away when a tooth is broken or knocked out. If you can find the tooth, bring it with you to the dentist. Follow the steps in the First Aid section above. If you cannot close your upper and lower teeth together, your jaw may be broken. This requires medical help right away at

This usually involves bandaging the jaw to keep the mouth from opening widely. In some cases, surgery is needed to do this, particularly if repeated jaw dislocations occur. After dislocating your jaw, you should not open your mouth widely for at least 6 weeks. Support your jaw with one or both hands when yawning and sneezing. DO NOT Do� not try to correct the position of the jaw. A doctor should do this. When to Contact a Medical Professional A broken or dislocated jaw requires� prompt medical attention. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing or heavy bleeding.

In most cases, only permanent teeth are replanted into the mouth. Baby teeth are not replanted. Causes Tooth accidents are commonly caused by: Accidental falls Sports-related

trauma Fighting Car accidents Biting on hard food First Aid Save any tooth that has been knocked out. Bring it to your dentist as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the less chance there is for your dentist to fix it. Hold the tooth only by the crown (chewing edge). You can take the tooth to the dentist in one of these ways: Try to place the tooth back in your mouth where it fell out, so it is level with other teeth. Bite down gently on a gauze or a wet tea bag to help keep it in place. Be careful not to swallow the tooth. If you cannot do the above step, place the tooth in a container and cover it with a small amount of cow's milk or saliva. You can also hold the tooth between your lower lip and gum or under your tongue. A tooth-saving storage device (Save-a-Tooth, EMT Tooth Saver) may be available at your dentist's office. This type of kit contains a travel case and fluid solution. Consider buying one for your home first aid kit . Also follow these steps: Apply a cold compress on the outside of your mouth and

tooth damage. Treatment may involve: Fillings Crowns Root canals Dentists fill teeth by removing the decayed tooth material with a drill and replacing it with a material such as composite resin, glass ionomer, or amalgam. Composite resin is the preferred material today, as it more closely matches the natural tooth appearance, and is also strong enough to use anywhere in the mouth, including the back teeth, where the majority of chewing takes place. Crowns or ""caps"" are used if tooth decay is extensive and there is limited tooth structure, which may cause weakened teeth. Large fillings and weak teeth increase the risk of tooth fracture. The decayed or weakened area is removed and repaired. A crown is fitted over the remainder of the tooth. Crowns are often made of gold, porcelain, or porcelain fused to metal. A root canal is recommended if the pulp is exposed to bacteria, or if the nerve in a tooth dies from decay or injury. The center of the tooth, including the nerve and blood vessel tissue (pulp), is removed along with decayed portions of the tooth. The roots are filled with a sealing material called gutta percha. The tooth is filled, and a crown","Broken or knocked out tooth can be prevented during work, sports, and recreation activities by using safety equipment, such as a helmet when playing football, or using mouth guards. This can help prevent or minimize injuries to the face or jaw. It's also important to be careful when biting on hard food to avoid accidental tooth damage. Maintaining good oral hygiene with regular professional cleanings, brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily, and avoiding chewy, sticky foods can also help prevent cavities and tooth damage.","Based on the provided context, here are ways to prevent a broken or knocked out tooth:

This may be due to: Assault Industrial accident Motor vehicle accident Recreational or sports injury Trips and falls After a dental or medical procedure Symptoms Symptoms of a broken jaw include: Pain in the face or jaw, located in front of the ear or on the affected side,� that gets worse with movement Bruising and swelling of the face, bleeding from the mouth Difficulty chewing Misaligned teeth or jaw Jaw stiffness, difficulty opening the mouth widely, or problem closing the mouth Jaw moving to one side when opening Jaw tenderness or pain, worse with biting or chewing Loose or damaged teeth Lump or abnormal appearance of the cheek or jaw Numbness

of the face (particularly the lower lip) Ear pain Symptoms of a dislocated jaw include: Pain in the face or jaw, located in front of the ear or on the affected side that gets worse with movement Bite that feels ""off"" or crooked Problems talking Inability to close the mouth Drooling because of inability to close the mouth Locked jaw or jaw that protrudes forward Teeth that do not line up properly First Aid A person with a broken or dislocated jaw needs medical attention right away. This is because they may have breathing problems or bleeding. Call 911 or the local emergency number or a local hospital for further advice. Hold the jaw gently in place with your hands on the way to the emergency room. You can also wrap a bandage under the jaw and over the top of the head. The bandage should be easy to remove in case you need to vomit. At the hospital, if you have breathing problems, heavy bleeding occurs, or severe swelling of your face, a tube may be placed into your airway to help you breathe. FRACTURED JAW Treatment for a fractured jaw depends on how badly the bone is broken.

round out the chin: You may be under general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). Or, you may get medicine to numb the area, along with a medicine that will make you relaxed and sleepy. A cut is made, either inside the mouth or outside under the chin. A pocket is created in front of the chin bone and under the muscles. The implant is placed inside. The surgeon may use real bone or fat tissue, or an implant made out of silicone, Teflon, Dacron, or newer biological inserts. The implant is often attached to the bone with stitches or screws. Sutures are used to close the surgical cut. When the cut is inside the mouth, the scar can barely be seen. The surgeon may also need to move some bones: You will likely be under general anesthesia. The surgeon will make a cut inside your mouth along the lower gum. This gives the surgeon access to the chin bone. The surgeon uses a bone saw or chisel to make a second cut through the jaw bone. The jaw bone is moved and wired or screwed in place with a metal plate. The cut is closed with stitches and a bandage is","Broken or dislocated jaw can be prevented during work, sports, and recreation activities by using safety equipment such as helmets when playing football, or using mouth guards.

What are the symptoms of Botulism?,"Development Title: Infant botulism Causes Clostridium botulinum is a spore-forming organism that is common in nature. The spores may be found in soil and certain foods (such as honey and some corn syrups). Infant botulism occurs mostly in young infants between 6 weeks and 6 months of age. It may occur as early as 6 days and as late as 1 year. Risk factors include swallowing honey as a baby, being around contaminated soil, and having less than one stool per day for a period greater than 2 months. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Breathing that stops or slows Constipation Eyelids that sag or partially close ""Floppy"" body Absence of gagging Loss of head control Paralysis that spreads downward Poor feeding and weak suckling Respiratory failure Extreme tiredness (lethargy) Weak cry Exams and Tests The health care provider will do a physical exam. This may show a decreased muscle tone, a missing or decreased gag reflex, missing or decreased deep tendon reflexes, and eyelid drooping. A stool sample from the baby may be checked for the botulinum toxin or bacteria. Electromyography (EMG ) can be done to help tell the difference between muscle and neurological problems. Treatment Botulism immune globulin is

may include: Constipation Drooling Poor feeding and weak sucking Respiratory distress Weak cry Weakness, loss of muscle tone Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. The exam may find: Absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes Absent or decreased gag reflex Eyelid drooping Loss of muscle function, starting at the top of the body and moving down Paralyzed bowel Speech impairment Urine retention with inability to urinate Blurred vision No fever Blood tests can be done to identify the toxin. A stool culture may also be ordered. Lab tests can be done on the suspected food to confirm botulism. Treatment You will need medicine to fight the toxin produced by the bacteria. The medicine is called botulism antitoxin. You will have to stay in the hospital if you have breathing trouble. A tube may be inserted through the nose or mouth into the windpipe to provide an airway for oxygen. You may need a breathing machine. People who have trouble swallowing may be given fluids through a vein (by IV). A feeding tube may be inserted.

Infant botulism Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Botulism Title: Bowel incontinence Considerations In adults age 65 and older, women tend to have problems with bowel control more often than men. Children who have problems with leakage due to toilet training problems or constipation may have encopresis . The rectum, anus, pelvic muscles, and nervous system must work together to control bowel movements. If there is a problem with any of these, it can cause incontinence. You must also be able to recognize and respond to the urge to have a bowel movement. Many people feel embarrassed about bowel incontinence and may not tell their health care provider. But incontinence can be treated. So you should tell your provider if you are having problems. Proper treatment can help most people gain control of their bowels. Exercises to make the anal and pelvic muscles stronger can help the bowels work properly. Causes Reasons people have bowel incontinence include: Ongoing (chronic) constipation. This causes the anal muscles and intestines to stretch and weaken, leading to diarrhea and stool leakage. Fecal impaction . It is most often caused by chronic constipation. This leads to a lump of stool that partly blocks the large intestine. Long-term","Botulism can be prevented by following these measures:

1. NEVER give honey or corn syrup to infants younger than 1 year old. Never give even just a little taste on a pacifier.

What are the symptoms of Brown recluse spider?,"States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the spider to the emergency room with you, if possible. Make sure it is in a secure container. The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. Because brown recluse spider bites can be painful, pain medicines may be given. Antibiotics may also be prescribed if the wound is infected. If the wound is near a joint (such as a knee or elbow), the arm or leg may be placed into a brace or sling. If practical, elevate the arm or leg. In more serious reactions, the person may receive: Blood and urine tests Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the

the trachea or bronchi. Acute rejection or infection after a lung transplant. Risks The main risks of bronchoscopy are: Bleeding from biopsy sites (most dangerous complication in very rare occasions) Infection There is also a small risk for: Abnormal heart rhythms Breathing difficulties Fever Heart attack, in people with existing heart disease Low blood oxygen Collapsed lung Sore throat Risks when general anesthesia is used include: Muscle pain Change in blood pressure Slower heart rate Nausea and vomiting Alternative Names Fiberoptic bronchoscopy; Lung cancer - bronchoscopy; Pneumonia - bronchoscopy; Chronic lung disease - bronchoscopy Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Breathing Problems Bronchial Disorders COPD Endoscopy Interstitial Lung Diseases Lung Cancer Lung Diseases Pulmonary Fibrosis Sarcoidosis Title: Brown recluse spider Poisonous Ingredient The venom of the brown recluse spider contains toxic chemicals that make people sick. Where Found The brown recluse spider is most common in the south and central states of the United States, especially in Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, eastern Texas, and Oklahoma. However, they have been found in several large cities outside these areas. The brown recluse spider prefers dark, sheltered areas, such as under porches and in woodpiles. Wear protective clothing when traveling through areas where these spiders

live. DO NOT put your hands or feet in their nests or in their preferred hiding places, such as dark, sheltered areas under logs or underbrush, or other damp, moist areas. Symptoms When the spider bites you, you may feel a sharp sting or nothing at all. Pain usually develops within the first several hours after being bitten, and may become severe. Children may have more serious reactions. Symptoms may include: Chills Itching General ill-feeling or discomfort Fever Nausea Reddish or purplish color in a circle around bite Sweating Large sore (ulcer) in the area of the bite Rarely, these symptoms may occur: Coma (lack of responsiveness) Blood in urine Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Kidney failure Seizures In serious cases, blood supply is cut off from the area of the bite. This results in black tissue scarring (eschar) at the site. The eschar sloughs off after about 2 to 5 weeks, leaving an ulcer through skin and fatty tissue. The ulcer may take many months to heal and leave a deep scar. Home Care Seek emergency medical treatment right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number, or poison control.

They must be treated quickly with antivenin by an experienced provider. Even with appropriate and quick treatment, symptoms may last for several days to weeks. The original bite may be small and may progress to a blood blister and look like a bull's eye. (This is similar to the appearance of a brown recluse spider bite.) The area affected by the bite may become deeper. Additional symptoms such as fever, chills, and other signs of additional organ system involvement may develop. Deep scarring may occur and surgery may be needed to improve appearance of the scar.

People with fewer medical complications of bulimia and those willing and able to take part in therapy have a better chance of recovery. Possible Complications Bulimia can be dangerous. It may lead to serious health problems over time. For example, vomiting over and over can cause: Stomach acid in the esophagus (the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach). This can lead to permanent damage of this area. Tears in the esophagus. Dental cavities. Swelling of the throat. Vomiting and overuse of enemas or laxatives can lead to: Your body not having as much water and fluid as it should Low level of potassium in the blood, which may lead to dangerous heart rhythm problems Hard stools or constipation Hemorrhoids Damage to the pancreas People with bulimia have a high risk for suicidal thoughts and suicidal attempts. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider for an appointment if you or your child has symptoms of an eating disorder. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides

relief. People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder. Symptoms that other people can see include: Spending a lot of time exercising Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (medicines that cause vomiting), or diuretics Exams and Tests A dental exam may show cavities or gum infections (such as gingivitis ). The enamel of the teeth may be worn away or pitted because of too much exposure to the acid in vomit. A physical exam may also show: Broken blood vessels in the eyes (from the strain of vomiting) Dry mouth Pouch-like look to the cheeks Rashes and pimples Small cuts and calluses across the tops of the finger joints from forcing oneself to vomit Blood tests may show an electrolyte imbalance (such as low potassium level ) or dehydration . Treatment People with bulimia rarely have to go to the hospital, unless they: Have anorexia Have major depression Need medicines

How well the person does depends on the amount they swallowed, how strong it is, and how quickly they receive medical treatment. Seizures can lead to permanent brain damage and possibly death. Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Pesticides Poisoning Title: Bulimia Causes Many more women than men have bulimia.� The disorder is most common in teenage girls and young women. The person usually knows that their eating pattern is abnormal. They may feel fear or guilt with the binge-purge episodes. The exact cause of bulimia is unknown. Genetic, psychological, family, society, or cultural factors may play a role. Bulimia is likely due to more than one factor. Symptoms With bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months. The person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating. Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include: Forcing oneself to vomit Excessive exercise Using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills) Purging often brings a sense of

to help them stop purging Most often, a stepped approach is used to treat bulimia. Treatment depends on how severe the bulimia is, and the person's response to treatments: Support groups may be helpful for mild bulimia without other health problems. Counseling, such as talk therapy and nutritional therapy are the first treatments for bulimia that does not respond to support groups. Medicines that also treat depression, known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used for bulimia. Combining talk therapy with SSRIs may help, if talk therapy alone does not work. People may drop out of programs if they have unrealistic hopes of being cured by therapy alone. Before a program begins, people should know that: Different therapies will likely be needed to manage this disorder. It is common for bulimia to return (relapse), and this is no cause for despair. The process is painful, and the person and their family will need to work hard. Support Groups The stress of illness can be eased by joining a support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) Bulimia is a long-term illness. Many people will still have some

free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.

What is the treatment for Bulimia?,"to help them stop purging Most often, a stepped approach is used to treat bulimia. Treatment depends on how severe the bulimia is, and the person's response to treatments: Support groups may be helpful for mild bulimia without other health problems. Counseling, such as talk therapy and nutritional therapy are the first treatments for bulimia that does not respond to support groups. Medicines that also treat depression, known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used for bulimia. Combining talk therapy with SSRIs may help, if talk therapy alone does not work. People may drop out of programs if they have unrealistic hopes of being cured by therapy alone. Before a program begins, people should know that: Different therapies will likely be needed to manage this disorder. It is common for bulimia to return (relapse), and this is no cause for despair. The process is painful, and the person and their family will need to work hard. Support Groups The stress of illness can be eased by joining a support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) Bulimia is a long-term illness. Many people will still have some

symptoms, even with treatment. People with fewer medical complications of bulimia and those willing and able to take part in therapy have a better chance of recovery. Possible Complications Bulimia can be dangerous. It may lead to serious health problems over time. For example, vomiting over and over can cause: Stomach acid in the esophagus (the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach). This can lead to permanent damage of this area. Tears in the esophagus. Dental cavities. Swelling of the throat. Vomiting and overuse of enemas or laxatives can lead to: Your body not having as much water and fluid as it should Low level of potassium in the blood, which may lead to dangerous heart rhythm problems Hard stools or constipation Hemorrhoids Damage to the pancreas People with bulimia have a high risk for suicidal thoughts and suicidal attempts. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider for an appointment if you or your child has symptoms of an eating disorder. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides

Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Pesticides Poisoning Title: Bulimia Causes Many more women than men have bulimia.� The disorder is most common in teenage girls and young women. The person usually knows that their eating pattern is abnormal. They may feel fear or guilt with the binge-purge episodes. The exact cause of bulimia is unknown. Genetic, psychological, family, society, or cultural factors may play a role. Bulimia is likely due to more than one factor. Symptoms With bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months. The person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating. Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include: Forcing oneself to vomit Excessive exercise Using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills) Purging often brings a sense of

relief. People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder. Symptoms that other people can see include: Spending a lot of time exercising Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (medicines that cause vomiting), or diuretics Exams and Tests A dental exam may show cavities or gum infections (such as gingivitis ). The enamel of the teeth may be worn away or pitted because of too much exposure to the acid in vomit. A physical exam may also show: Broken blood vessels in the eyes (from the strain of vomiting) Dry mouth Pouch-like look to the cheeks Rashes and pimples Small cuts and calluses across the tops of the finger joints from forcing oneself to vomit Blood tests may show an electrolyte imbalance (such as low potassium level ) or dehydration .

This can involve daily drainage to remove sputum, coughing exercises shown by a respiratory therapist, medicines such as antibiotics, bronchodilators, and expectorants, and in some cases, surgery to remove (resect) the lung or a lung transplant. The specific treatment depends on the cause and severity of the disease. It's also important to follow a healthy lifestyle to help manage symptoms, such as avoiding smoking and pollution.","The treatment for Bronchiectasis aims at:

1. **Controlling infections and sputum**: This is often done with antibiotics to treat infections and expectorants to help loosen and cough up thick sputum.

2. **Relieving airway blockage**: Bronchodilators are used to open up airways. Daily drainage techniques and coughing exercises, often shown by a respiratory therapist, can help remove sputum.

3. **Preventing the problem from becoming worse** and **treating the underlying cause**: For example, modulator therapy can be used for people with cystic fibrosis, which is one of the causes of bronchiectasis.

In severe cases, surgery to remove part of the lung or lung transplantation might be needed. However, these are considered only under specific conditions, such as when medicine does not work, the disease is in a small area, or there is a lot of bleeding in the lungs.",0.895841658115387,0.32599118942731276,0.9114472270011902,0.45714285714285713,0.7295681881747057

Treatment includes: Medicines Physical therapy Exercise Education to help you understand the nature of RA, your treatment options, and the need for regular follow-up. Surgery, if required Early treatment for RA with medicines called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be used in all patients. This will slow joint destruction and prevent deformities. The activity of the RA should be checked at regular visits to make sure the disease is under control. The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the RA. MEDICINES Anti-inflammatory medicines: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen and celecoxib. These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible. Since they do not prevent joint damage if used alone, DMARDs should be used as well. Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These are

What are the symptoms of Biliary atresia?,"Viral infection after birth Exposure to toxic substances Multiple genetic factors Perinatal injury Some medicines such as carbamazepine It more commonly affects people of East Asian and African-American descent. The bile ducts help remove waste from the liver and carry salts that help the small intestine break down (digest) fat. In babies with biliary atresia, bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which can be deadly. Symptoms Symptoms usually start to occur between 2 to 8 weeks. Jaundice (a yellow color to the skin and mucus membranes) develops slowly 2 to 3 weeks after birth. The infant may gain weight normally for the first month. After that point, the baby will lose weight and become irritable, and will have worsening jaundice. Other symptoms may include: Dark urine Swollen belly Foul-smelling and floating stools Pale or clay-colored stools Slow growth Exams and Tests Your health care provider will take medical history of your child and do a physical exam to check for enlarged liver. Tests to diagnose biliary atresia include: Abdominal x-ray to check for enlarged liver and spleen Abdominal ultrasound to check internal organs Blood tests

There are genetic tests to look for the causes of some forms of the disorder. But, no specific test is available in many cases. An MRI of the brain may show changes in the size of affected brain structures, especially as the disease gets worse. But it is possible to have the disorder and have a normal MRI.

Chlorpromazine is fairly safe. Most likely, an overdose will only cause drowsiness and some side effects such as uncontrolled movements of the lips, eyes, head, and neck for a short time. These movements may continue if they are not treated quickly and correctly. In rare cases, an overdose can cause more serious symptoms. Nervous system symptoms may be permanent. The most serious side effects are usually due to damage to the heart. If heart damage can be stabilized, recovery is likely. Life threatening heart rhythm disturbances may be difficult to treat, and may result in death. Survival past 2 days is usually a good sign. Title: Choanal atresia Causes The cause of choanal atresia is unknown. It is thought to occur when the thin tissue separating the nose and mouth area during fetal development remains after birth. The condition is the most common nasal abnormality in newborn infants. Females get this condition about twice as often as males. More than half of affected infants also have other congenital problems. Choanal atresia is most often diagnosed shortly after birth while the infant is still in the hospital.

It occurs when the body does not properly break down (metabolize) a certain form of bilirubin . Bilirubin levels rapidly build up in the body. The high levels are poisonous to the brain and can cause death. Symptoms The newborn may have: Yellow skin (jaundice) Yellow eyes (icterus) Lethargy If untreated, seizures and neurologic problems (kernicterus) may develop. Exams and Tests Blood tests for bilirubin levels can identify the severity of the jaundice. Treatment Phototherapy with blue light is used to treat the high level of bilirubin.

Children who have many of these spots, or large spots, may be more likely to have a condition called neurofibromatosis. Red birthmarks may include: Port-wine stains -- growths that contain blood vessels (vascular growths). They are red to purplish in color. They are frequently seen on the face, but may occur on any area of the body. Hemangiomas -- a collection of capillaries (small blood vessels) that may appear at birth or a few months later. Stork bites -- small red patches on the baby's forehead, eyelids, back of the neck, or upper lip. They are caused by stretching of the blood vessels. They often go away within 18 months.

How can Bleeding be prevented?,"a special type of CT scan that shows active bleeding into the intestine. Complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia. Colonoscopy. Stool test for occult (hidden) blood (a positive test result suggests bleeding from the colon). Treatment It is important to find the cause of bleeding in the colon and how fast the blood is being lost. You may need to be admitted to a hospital. Fluids may be given through a vein, and blood products may be required. Other treatment may be needed once the source of bleeding is found. In most cases, the bleeding stops on its own without treatment. If treatment is needed, it may involve: Angiography to help block the blood vessel that is bleeding or to deliver medicine to help cause the blood vessels to tighten to stop the bleeding. Burning (cauterizing) the site of the bleed with heat, argon plasma coagulation, or laser using a colonoscope. Medicines: A medicine called octreotide can be injected to help treat the problem. In some cases, surgery is the only option. You may need the entire right side of the colon (right hemicolectomy) removed if heavy bleeding continues, even after other treatments have been tried.

This is very important if you think there is internal bleeding. Internal bleeding can very quickly become life threatening. Immediate medical care is needed. Serious injuries may cause heavy bleeding. Sometimes, minor injuries can bleed a lot. An example is a scalp wound. You may bleed a lot if you take blood-thinning medicine or have a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia . Bleeding in such people requires medical attention right away. The most important step for external bleeding is to apply direct pressure. This will likely stop most external bleeding. Always wash your hands before (if possible) and after giving first aid to someone who is bleeding. This helps prevent infection. Try to use latex gloves when treating someone who is bleeding. Latex gloves should be in every first aid kit. People allergic to latex can use nonlatex gloves. You can catch infections, such as viral hepatitis or HIV/AIDS,

If massive bleeding occurs, a person may need to be put on a ventilator to protect their airway and prevent blood from going down into the lungs. To stop the bleeding, the provider may pass an endoscope (tube with a small light at the end) into the esophagus: A clotting medicine may be injected into the varices. A rubber band may be placed around the bleeding varices (called banding or band ligation). Banding is the most common endoscopic treatment for esophageal varices. Other treatments to stop the bleeding: A medicine to tighten blood vessels may be given through a vein. Examples include octreotide or vasopressin . Rarely, a tube may be inserted through the nose into the stomach and inflated with air. This produces pressure against the bleeding veins (balloon tamponade). Once the bleeding is stopped, other varices can be treated with medicines and medical procedures to prevent future bleeding. These include: Drugs called beta blockers, such as propranolol, nadolol, and carvedilol that reduce portal vein pressure and the risk of bleeding. A rubber band can be placed around the varices during an EGD procedure. Also, some medicines can be injected

scrapes (abrasions) is often described as oozing, because it is slow. Lay the person down. This reduces the chances of fainting by increasing blood flow to the brain. When possible, raise up the part of the body that is bleeding. Remove any loose debris or dirt that you can see from a wound. Do not remove an object such as a knife, stick, or arrow that is stuck in the body. Doing so may cause more damage and bleeding. Place pads and bandages around the object and tape the object in place. Put pressure directly on an external wound with a sterile bandage, clean cloth, or even a piece of clothing. If nothing else is available, use your hand. Direct pressure is best for external bleeding, except for an eye injury. Maintain pressure until the bleeding stops. When it has stopped, tightly wrap the wound dressing with adhesive tape or a piece of clean clothing. Do not peek to see if the bleeding has stopped. If bleeding continues and seeps through the material being held on the wound, do not remove it. Simply place another cloth over the first one. Be sure to seek medical attention right away. If the

Once the bleeding is stopped, other varices can be treated with medicines and medical procedures to prevent future bleeding. These include: Drugs called beta blockers, such as propranolol, nadolol, and carvedilol that reduce portal vein pressure and the risk of bleeding. A rubber band can be placed around the varices during an EGD procedure. Also, some medicines can be injected

into the varices during EGD to cause them to clot. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This is a procedure to create new connections between two blood vessels in your liver. This can decrease pressure in the varices and prevent bleeding episodes from happening again. In rare cases, emergency surgery may be used to treat people if other treatment fails. Portacaval shunts or surgery to reduce the pressure in the esophageal varices are treatment options, but these procedures are risky. People with bleeding varices from liver disease may need more treatment for their liver disease, including a liver transplant. Outlook (Prognosis) Bleeding often comes back with or without treatment. Bleeding esophageal varices are a serious complication of liver disease and have a poor outcome. Placement of a shunt can lead to an increase of metabolic toxins gong to the brain. This can lead to mental status changes. Possible Complications Future problems caused by varices may include: Narrowing or stricture of the esophagus due to scarring after a procedure Return of bleeding after treatment When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider or go to an emergency room if you vomit blood or have black tarry stools. Prevention Treating the causes

part of the stomach. These are called gastric varices. Symptoms People with chronic liver disease and esophageal varices may have no symptoms. If there is only a small amount of bleeding, the only symptom may be dark or black streaks in the stools. If larger amounts of bleeding occur, symptoms may include: Black, tarry stools Bloody stools Lightheadedness Paleness Symptoms of chronic liver disease Vomiting blood Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do a physical exam which may show: Bloody or black stool (in a rectal exam) Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Signs of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis Tests to find the source of the bleeding and check if there is active bleeding include: EGD or upper endoscopy, which involves the use of a camera on a flexible tube to examine the esophagus and stomach. Insertion of a tube through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric tube) to look for signs of bleeding. Some providers suggest EGD for people who are newly diagnosed with mild to moderate cirrhosis. This test screens for esophageal varices and treats them before there is bleeding. Treatment The goal of treatment is to stop acute bleeding as soon as possible. Bleeding

often occurs due to liver damage caused by: Cirrhosis due to alcohol use Chronic viral hepatitis Blood clots Certain congenital disorders Primary biliary cirrhosis (liver scarring caused by blocked bile ducts) When blood can't flow normally through the portal vein, it takes another path. As a result, swollen blood vessels called varices form. The most important location for these is in the esophagus. They develop thin walls that can break and bleed into the esophagus and stomach. You may have this surgery if imaging tests such as upper GI endoscopy or x-rays show that you have bleeding varices in the esophagus or stomach. DSRS surgery reduces pressure in the varices and helps control bleeding. Risks Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are: Allergic reactions to medicines or breathing problems Bleeding, blood clots, or infection Risks of this surgery include: Buildup of fluid in the belly (ascites) Repeat bleeding from the varices Encephalopathy (loss of brain function because the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood) Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or a pancreatic pseudocyst (fluid collection that forms by the pancreas that can cause pain) Clotting of the shunt Portal vein thrombosis Before the Procedure Before the

Alternative Names Coagulopathy Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Bleeding Disorders Title: Bleeding esophageal varices Causes Scarring ( cirrhosis ) of the liver is the most common cause of esophageal varices. This scarring cuts down on blood flowing through the liver. As a result, more blood flows through the veins of the esophagus. The extra blood flow causes the veins in the esophagus to balloon outward forming esophageal varices. Heavy bleeding can occur if the varices tear. Any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease can cause esophageal varices. Varices can also occur in the upper","Prevention of Bleeding esophageal varices primarily involves treating the underlying causes of liver disease. This may include:

1. Lifestyle modifications: For alcohol-related liver disease, reducing or abstaining from alcohol consumption is crucial.
2. Hepatitis vaccination: Getting vaccinated against hepatitis B and C can help prevent chronic viral hepatitis, a common cause of liver disease and esophageal varices.
3. Medication management: Taking medications as prescribed to manage conditions like autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis can help slow the progression of liver disease.
4. Regular medical check-ups: Regular monitoring of liver function","Based on the provided context, here are ways to prevent bleeding esophageal varices:

1. **Treating the causes**: Addressing the underlying liver disease can help prevent varices. This may involve treating conditions like cirrhosis, hepatitis, or other liver diseases.

2. **Medications**: Drugs called beta blockers, such as propranolol, nadolol, and carvedilol, can reduce portal vein pressure and the risk of bleeding.

3. **Medical procedures**:
   - A rubber band can be placed around the varices during an EGD procedure (called banding or band ligation).
   - Medicines can be injected into the varices during EGD to cause them to clot.
   - A procedure called Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) can decrease pressure in the varices.

4. **Screening**: Some providers suggest EGD for people who are newly diagnosed with mild to moderate cirrhosis to screen for and treat esophageal varices before there is bleeding.

5. **Avoiding triggers**: Avoid things that can cause bleeding, such as alcohol use, certain medications, or activities that may increase pressure in the portal vein.",0.7654611468315125,0.18823529411764706,0.8480440974235535,0.3918918918918919,0.6170682761949652

How can Blockage of upper airway be prevented?,"blockage. Objects stuck in the airway may be removed with special instruments. A tube may be inserted into the airway ( endotracheal tube ) to help with breathing. Sometimes an opening is made through the neck into the airway ( tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy). If the obstruction is due to a foreign body, such as a piece of food that has been breathed in, doing abdominal thrusts , back blows, or chest compressions can save the person's life. Outlook (Prognosis) Prompt treatment is often successful. But the condition is dangerous and may be fatal, even when treated. Possible Complications If the obstruction is not relieved, it can cause: Brain damage Breathing failure Death When to Contact a Medical Professional Airway obstruction is often an emergency. Call 911 or the local emergency number for medical help. Follow instructions on how to help keep the person breathing until help arrives. Prevention Prevention depends on the cause of the upper airway obstruction. The following methods may help prevent an obstruction: Eat slowly and chew food completely. Do not drink too much alcohol before or while eating. Keep small objects away from young children. Make sure dentures fit properly. Learn to recognize the universal sign

Your health care provider will do a complete eye exam. The treatment will depend on the cause of the vision loss.

is best done in the operating room or a similar setting where sudden breathing problems can be more easily handled. Tests that may be done include: Blood culture or throat culture Complete blood count � (CBC) Neck x-ray Treatment A hospital stay is needed, usually in the intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment involves methods to help the person breathe, including: Breathing tube ( intubation) Moistened (humidified) oxygen A surgical airway, called tracheostomy, as a last resort if other measures fail Other treatments may include: Antibiotics to treat the infection Anti-inflammatory medicines, called corticosteroids, to decrease throat swelling Fluids given through a vein (by IV) Outlook (Prognosis) Epiglottitis can be a life-threatening emergency. With proper treatment, the outcome is usually good. When to Contact a Medical Professional Seek immediate medical attention or call 911 or the local emergency number if a person has breathing trouble. Difficulty breathing is a late, but important sign. Spasm may cause the airways to suddenly close. Or, the airways may become totally blocked. Either of these situations could result in death. Prevention The Hib vaccine protects most children from epiglottitis. The most common bacteria ( H influenza type b ) that causes epiglottitis is easily spread.

inside your chest. This can happen if the upper airway (trachea) or small airways of the lungs (bronchioles) become partially blocked. As a result, the intercostal muscles are sucked inward, between the ribs, when you breathe. This is a sign of a partially or completely blocked airway . Any health problem that causes a blockage in the airway will cause intercostal retractions. Causes Intercostal retractions may be caused by: A severe, whole-body allergic reaction called anaphylaxis Asthma Swelling and mucus buildup in the smallest air passages in the lungs ( bronchiolitis ) Problem breathing and a barking cough ( croup ) Inflammation of the tissue ( epiglottis ) that covers the windpipe Foreign body in the windpipe Pneumonia A lung problem in newborns called respiratory distress syndrome Collection of pus in the tissues in the back of the throat ( retropharyngeal abscess ) When to Contact a Medical Professional Seek medical help right away if intercostal retractions occur. This can be a sign of a blocked airway, which can quickly become life threatening. Also seek medical care if the skin, lips, or nailbeds turn blue ( cyanosis ), or if the person becomes confused, drowsy, or is hard to wake

conditioning on. Using an air cleaner/purifier can also help. When you do have to go outside, wear a paper or gauze surgical mask that covers your nose and mouth. Wet the mask with a solution of baking soda and water to further protect your lungs. Wear goggles to protect your eyes from ash. Take your COPD or asthma medicines as prescribed. Do not smoke. Smoking can irritate your lungs even more. Drink a lot of fluids, especially warm fluids (such as tea). Bend forward at the waist slightly to make it easier to breathe. Practice breathing exercises indoors to keep your lungs as healthy as possible. With your lips almost closed, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. This is called pursed-lip breathing. Or, breathe deeply through your nose into your belly without moving your chest. This is called diaphragmatic breathing. If possible, leave or do not travel to the area where the volcanic smog is. EMERGENCY SYMPTOMS If you have asthma or COPD and your symptoms suddenly get worse, try using your rescue inhaler. If your symptoms don't improve: Call 911 or the local emergency number right away. Have someone take you to the emergency room.","Prevention of blockage of the upper airway depends on the cause.

Tests to diagnose a brain abscess may include: Blood cultures Chest x-ray Complete blood count ( CBC ) Head CT scan Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) MRI of head Testing for the presence of antibodies to certain germs A needle biopsy is usually performed to identify the cause of the infection. Treatment A brain abscess is a medical emergency. Pressure inside the skull may become high enough to be life threatening. You will need to stay in the hospital until the condition is stable. Some people may need life support. Medicine such as an antibiotic, not surgery, is recommended if you have: A small abscess (less than 2 cm) An abscess deep in the brain An abscess and meningitis Several abscesses (rare) Shunts in the brain for hydrocephalus (in some cases, the shunt may need to be removed temporarily or replaced) An infection called toxoplasmosis in a person with HIV/AIDS You may be prescribed several different types of antibiotics to make sure treatment works. Antifungal medicines may also be prescribed

if the infection is likely caused by a fungus. Surgery is needed if: Increased pressure in the brain continues or gets worse The brain abscess does not get smaller after medicine The brain abscess contains gas (produced by some types of bacteria) The brain abscess might break open (rupture) The brain abscess is large (more than 2 cm) Surgery consists of opening the skull, exposing the brain, and draining the abscess. Laboratory tests are often done to examine the fluid. This helps identify the cause of the infection, so that the right antibiotics or antifungal medicine can be prescribed. Needle aspiration guided by CT or MRI scan may be needed for a deep abscess. During this procedure, medicines may be injected directly into the mass. Certain diuretics (medicines that reduce fluid in the body, also called water pills) and steroids may also be used to reduce the swelling of the brain. Outlook (Prognosis) If untreated, a brain abscess is almost always deadly. With treatment, the death rate is about 10% to 30%. The earlier treatment is received, the better. Some people may have long-term nervous system problems after a brain abscess or surgery. Possible Complications Complications may include: Brain damage

white blood cells, live and dead bacteria or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass or abscess. The germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery. In some cases, a brain abscess develops from an infection in the sinuses. The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common identified source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause.

Tests that may be done include: Blood culture � to check for bacteria in the blood Complete blood count ( CBC ) CT scan of head or spine Draining of abscess and examination of the material MRI of head or spine Urine analysis and culture Treatment The goal of treatment is to cure the infection and reduce the risk for permanent damage. Treatment usually includes antibiotics and surgery. In some cases, antibiotics alone are used. Antibiotics are usually given through a vein (IV) for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Some people need to take them for a longer time, depending on the type of bacteria and how severe the disease is. Surgery may be needed to drain or remove the abscess. Surgery is also often needed to reduce pressure on the spinal cord or brain, if there

is weakness or damage to the nerves. Outlook (Prognosis) Early diagnosis and treatment greatly improve the chance of a good outcome. Once weakness, paralysis , or sensation changes occur, the chance of recovering lost function is greatly reduced. Permanent nervous system damage or death may occur.

Blood pressure medicines, such as ACE inhibitors , for high blood pressure or kidney problems. Light therapy to relieve skin thickening. Medicines to improve lung function, such as bosentan and sildenafil. Treatment often involves physical therapy as well. Support Groups Some people can benefit from attending a support group for people with scleroderma. Outlook (Prognosis) In some people, symptoms develop quickly for the first few years and continue to get worse. However, in most people, the disease gets worse only slowly. People who have only skin symptoms have a better outlook. Widespread (systemic) scleroderma can lead to. Heart failure Scarring of the lungs, called pulmonary fibrosis High blood pressure in the lungs ( pulmonary

lactic acid), blood fats (lipids), and uric acid. Treatment The goal of treatment is to avoid low blood sugar. Eat frequently during the day, especially foods that contain carbohydrates (starches). Older children and adults may take cornstarch by mouth to increase their carbohydrate intake. In some children, a feeding tube is placed through their nose into the stomach throughout the night to provide sugars or uncooked cornstarch. The tube can be taken out each morning. Alternatively, a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) can be placed to deliver food directly to the stomach overnight. A medicine to lower uric acid in the blood and decrease the risk for gout may be prescribed. Your provider may also prescribe medicines to treat kidney disease, high lipids, and to increase the cells that fight infection.

to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests Autoantibody tests Complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell differential (CBC with WBC differential) Comprehensive metabolic panel C-reactive protein (CRP) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Urinalysis Treatment The goals of treatment are to: Control the autoimmune process Maintain your body's ability to fight disease Reduce symptoms Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include: Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease Blood transfusions if blood is affected Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers and Interleukin inhibitors can be used for some diseases. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic , but many can be controlled with treatment. Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Possible","The treatment for Blount disease typically involves surgery to correct the deformity and allow the leg to grow properly. This surgery aims to restrict the growth of the outer half of the shin bone, allowing the natural growth to reverse the bowing process. If the leg can be placed into the proper position, the outlook is generally good, and the leg should work properly and look normal. However, failure to treat Blount disease may lead to progressive deformity, differences in leg lengths, and potential disability. It's essential to contact a medical professional if a child's leg or legs appear to be bowing or if the bowing seems to be getting worse.","Based on the provided context, the treatment for Blount disease may involve surgery. One type of surgery restricts the growth of the outer half of the shin bone, allowing the child's natural growth to reverse the bowing process. This surgery is typically more successful in children with less severe symptoms who still have significant growth ahead.

How can Blount disease be prevented?,"times, surgery is done to restrict the growth of the outer half of the shin bone. This allows the child's natural growth to reverse the bowing process. This is a much smaller surgery. It works best in children with less severe symptoms who still have quite a bit of growing to do. Outlook (Prognosis) If the leg can be placed into the proper position, the outlook is good. The leg should work properly and look normal. Possible Complications Failure to treat Blount disease may lead to progressive deformity. The condition may lead to differences in leg lengths, which can result in disability if not treated. Blount disease may come back after surgery, especially in younger children. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your child's provider if your child's leg or legs appear to be bowing.

The North American form of BL is not commonly linked to EBV. People with HIV/AIDS have an increased risk for this condition. BL is most often seen in males. Symptoms BL may first be noticed as a swelling of the lymph nodes (glands) in the head and neck. These swollen lymph nodes are often painless, but can grow very rapidly.

can prevent hepatitis B . Hepatitis B is a liver disease that can cause mild illness lasting a few weeks, or it can lead to a serious, lifelong illness. Acute hepatitis B is a short-term illness that can lead to fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements), and pain in the muscles, joints, and stomach. Chronic hepatitis B is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person's body. Most people who go on to develop chronic hepatitis B do not have symptoms, but it is still very serious and can lead to liver damage (cirrhosis), liver cancer, and death. Chronically infected people can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they do not feel or look sick themselves. Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluid infected with the hepatitis B virus enters the body of a person who is not infected. People can become infected through: Birth (if a pregnant woman has hepatitis B, their baby can become infected) Sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person Contact with the blood or open sores of an

People with severely low levels of B12 may need more shots in the beginning. Some people may be adequately treated by taking large doses of vitamin B12 supplements by mouth. A certain type of vitamin B12 may be given through the nose. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people often do well with treatment. It is important to start treatment early. Nerve damage can be permanent if treatment does not start within 6 months of symptoms. Possible Complications People with pernicious anemia may have gastric polyps.

What are the symptoms of Brain tumor - primary - adults?,"of all cancers that spread through the body. They are much more common than primary brain tumors (tumors that start in the brain). Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Decreased coordination , clumsiness, falls General ill feeling or fatigue Headache , new or more severe than usual Memory loss, poor judgment, difficulty solving problems Numbness, tingling, pain, and other changes in sensation Personality changes Rapid emotional changes or strange behaviors Seizures that are new Problems with speech Vision changes , double vision, decreased vision Vomiting, with or without nausea Weakness of a body area Specific symptoms vary. Common symptoms of most types of metastatic brain tumors are caused by increased pressure in the brain. Exams and Tests An exam can show brain and nervous system changes based on where the tumor is in the brain. Signs of increased pressure in the skull are also common. Some tumors may not show signs until they are very large. Then, they can cause a very quick decline in nervous system function. The original (primary) tumor may be found by examining tumor tissues from the brain. Tests may include: Mammogram , CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to find the

10. Ependymomas are a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign or malignant. Therapy to control the tumor is based on the location and type of ependymoma. Brainstem gliomas are very rare tumors that occur almost only in children. The average age at which they develop in children is about age 6. Symptoms Symptoms may be subtle and slowly become worse, or they may occur very quickly. Headaches are often the most common symptom. But only very rarely do children with headaches have a tumor. Headache patterns that may occur with brain tumors include: Headaches that are worse when waking up in the morning and go away within a few hours Headaches that get worse with coughing or exercise, or with a change in body position Headaches that occur while sleeping and with at least one other symptom such as vomiting or confusion Sometimes, the only symptoms of brain tumors are mental changes, which may include: Changes in personality and behavior Unable to concentrate Increased sleep Memory loss Problems with reasoning Other possible symptoms are: Seizures Unexplained frequent vomiting Gradual loss of movement or feeling in an arm or leg Hearing loss with or without dizziness Speech difficulty

control over the bladder or bowels Loss of balance or coordination, clumsiness, trouble walking Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually on just one side) Numbness or tingling on one side of the body Personality, mood, behavior, or emotional changes Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking Other symptoms that may occur with a pituitary tumor: Abnormal nipple discharge Absent menstruation (periods) Breast development in men Enlarged hands, feet Excessive body hair Facial changes Low blood pressure Obesity Sensitivity to heat or cold Exams and Tests The following tests may confirm the presence of a brain tumor and find its location: CT scan of the head EEG (to measure the electrical activity of the brain) Examination of tissue removed from the tumor during surgery or CT-guided biopsy (may confirm the type of tumor) Examination of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) (may show cancerous cells) MRI of the head Treatment Treatment can involve surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

depends on many things, including the type of tumor. In general, about 3 out of 4 children survive at least 5 years after being diagnosed. Long-term brain and nervous system problems may result from the tumor itself or from treatment. Children may have problems with attention, focus, or memory. They may also have problems processing information, planning, insight, or initiative or desire to do things. Children younger than age 7, especially younger than age 3, seem to be at greatest risk of these complications. Parents need to make sure that children receive support services at home and at school.

What is the treatment for Brain tumor - primary - adults?,"for certain tumors. The following are treatments for specific types of tumors: Astrocytoma: Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be needed. Brainstem gliomas: Surgery may not be possible because of the tumor's location deep in the brain. Radiation is used to shrink the tumor and prolong life. Sometimes targeted chemotherapy can be used. Ependymomas: Treatment includes surgery. Radiation and chemotherapy may be necessary. Medulloblastomas: Surgery alone does not cure this type of tumor. Chemotherapy with or without radiation is often used in combination with surgery. Medicines used to treat children with primary brain tumors include: Corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling Diuretics (water pills) to reduce brain swelling and pressure Anticonvulsants to reduce or prevent seizures Pain medicines Chemotherapy to help shrink the tumor or prevent the tumor from growing back Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other such steps may be required to improve quality of life. Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you and your child feel less alone.

size and type of tumor and your general health. Goals of treatment may be to cure the tumor, relieve symptoms, and improve brain function or comfort. Surgery is often needed for most primary brain tumors. Some tumors may be completely removed. Those that are deep inside the brain or that enter brain tissue may be debulked instead of removed. Debulking is a procedure to reduce the tumor's size. Tumors can be hard to remove completely by surgery alone. This is because the tumor invades surrounding brain tissue much like roots from a plant spread through soil. When the tumor cannot be removed, surgery may still help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms. Radiation therapy is used for certain tumors. Chemotherapy may be used with surgery or radiation treatment. Other medicines used to treat primary brain tumors may include: Medicines to reduce brain swelling and pressure Anticonvulsants to reduce seizures Pain medicines Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, and occupational therapy may be needed to improve quality of life. Counseling, support groups, and similar measures can help people cope with the disorder. You may consider enrolling in a clinical trial after talking with your treatment team. Possible Complications Complications that may result

form of radiation therapy focuses high-power x-rays on a small area of the brain. It is used when there are only a few, small, metastatic tumors. Medicines for brain tumor symptoms include: Anticonvulsants such as phenytoin or levetiracetam to reduce or prevent seizures Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone to reduce brain swelling Pain medicines When the cancer has spread, treatment may focus on relieving pain and other symptoms. This is called palliative or supportive care. Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatments may improve the patient's quality of life. Some people may want to seek legal advice to help them create an advance directive and power of attorney for health care. Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) For many people with metastatic brain tumors, the cancer is not curable. Prognosis depends on the type of tumor and how it responds to treatment. Possible Complications Health problems that may result include: Brain herniation (fatal) Loss of ability to function or care for self Loss of ability to interact Permanent, severe loss

Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is often used to treat tumors that have spread to the brain, especially if there are many tumors, and surgery is not a good option. Surgery may be used when there is a single tumor. Some tumors may be completely removed. Tumors that are deep or that extend into brain tissue may be reduced in size (debulked). Surgery may reduce pressure and relieve symptoms in cases when the tumor cannot be removed. Chemotherapy for metastatic brain tumors is usually not as helpful as surgery or radiation. Some types of tumors, though, do respond to chemotherapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may also be used. This

Alternative Names Airway obstruction - acute upper Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Choking Throat Disorders Tracheal Disorders Title: Blocked tear duct Causes Tears are constantly being made to help protect the surface of your eye. They drain into a very small opening (punctum) in the corner of your eye, near your nose. This opening is the entrance to the nasolacrimal duct. If this duct is blocked, the tears will build up and overflow onto the cheek. This occurs even when you are not crying. In children, the duct may not be completely developed at birth. It may be closed or covered by a thin film, which causes a partial blockage. In adults, the duct can be damaged by an infection, injury, or a tumor. Symptoms The main symptom is increased tearing (epiphora), which causes tears to overflow onto the face or cheek. In babies, this tearing becomes noticeable during the first 2� to 3 weeks after birth. Sometimes, the tears may appear to be thicker. The

there is not too much damage. Surgery using tiny tubes or stents to open the passageway may be needed to restore normal tear drainage. Outlook (Prognosis) For infants, a blocked tear duct will most often go away on its own before the child is 1 year old. If not, the outcome is still likely to be good with probing. In adults, the outlook for a blocked tear duct varies, depending on the cause and how long the blockage has been present. Possible Complications Tear duct blockage may lead to an infection (dacryocystitis) in part of the nasolacrimal duct called the lacrimal sac. Most often, there is a bump on the side of the nose right next to the corner of the eye. Treatment for this often requires oral antibiotics. Sometimes, the sac needs to be surgically drained. Tear duct blockage can also increase the chance of other infections, such as conjunctivitis. When to Contact a Medical Professional See your provider if you have tear overflow onto the cheek. Earlier treatment is more successful. In the case of a tumor, early treatment may be life-saving. Prevention Many cases cannot be prevented. Proper treatment of nasal infections and conjunctivitis may reduce the

tears may dry and become crusty. If there is pus in the eyes or the eyelids get stuck together, your baby may have an eye infection called conjunctivitis . Exams and Tests Most of the time, the health care provider will not need to do any tests. Tests that may be done include: Eye exam Special eye stain ( fluorescein ) to see how tears drain X-ray studies to examine the tear duct (rarely done) Treatment Carefully clean the eyelids using a warm, wet washcloth if tears build up and leave crusts. For infants, you may try gently massaging the area 2� to 3 times a day. Using a clean finger, rub the area from the inside corner of the eye toward the nose. This may help to open the tear duct. Most of the time, the tear duct will open on its own by the time the infant is 1 year old. If this does not happen, probing may be necessary. This procedure is most often done using general anesthesia, so the child will be asleep and pain-free. It is almost always successful. In adults, the cause of the blockage must be treated. This may re-open the duct if

Choanal atresia blocking both sides of the nose causes acute breathing problems with bluish discoloration and breathing failure. Such infants may need resuscitation at delivery. More than one half of infants have a blockage on only one side, which causes less severe problems. Symptoms include: Chest retracts unless the child is breathing through mouth or crying. Difficulty breathing following birth, which may result in cyanosis (bluish discoloration), unless infant is crying. Inability to nurse and breathe at same time. Inability to pass a catheter through each side of the nose into the throat. Persistent one-sided nasal blockage or discharge. Exams and Tests A physical exam may show an obstruction of the nose. Tests that may be done include: CT scan Endoscopy of the nose Sinus x-ray Treatment The immediate concern is to resuscitate the baby if necessary. An airway may need to be placed so that the infant can breathe. In some cases, intubation may be needed. An infant can learn to mouth breathe, which can delay the need for immediate surgery.

It may be closed or covered by a thin film, which causes a partial blockage. In adults, the duct can be damaged by an infection, injury, or a tumor. Symptoms The main symptom is increased tearing (epiphora), which causes tears to overflow onto the face or cheek. In babies, this tearing becomes noticeable during the first 2� to 3 weeks after birth. Sometimes, the tears may appear to be thicker. The

tears may dry and become crusty. If there is pus in the eyes or the eyelids get stuck together, your baby may have an eye infection called conjunctivitis . Exams and Tests Most of the time, the health care provider will not need to do any tests. Tests that may be done include: Eye exam Special eye stain ( fluorescein ) to see how tears drain X-ray studies to examine the tear duct (rarely done) Treatment Carefully clean the eyelids using a warm, wet washcloth if tears build up and leave crusts. For infants, you may try gently massaging the area 2� to 3 times a day. Using a clean finger, rub the area from the inside corner of the eye toward the nose. This may help to open the tear duct. Most of the time, the tear duct will open on its own by the time the infant is 1 year old. If this does not happen, probing may be necessary. This procedure is most often done using general anesthesia, so the child will be asleep and pain-free. It is almost always successful. In adults, the cause of the blockage must be treated. This may re-open the duct if

the blockage. The balloon on the end is blown up (inflated). This opens the blocked vessel and restores proper blood flow to the heart. A wire mesh tube (stent) may then be placed in this blocked area. The stent is inserted along with the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is inflated. The stent is left there to help keep the artery open. The stent is almost always coated with a drug (called a drug-eluting stent). This type of stent may lower the chance of the artery closing back up in the future. Why the Procedure is Performed Arteries can become narrowed or blocked by deposits called plaque. Plaque is made up of fat and cholesterol that builds up on the inside of artery walls. This condition is called hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Angioplasty may be used to treat: Blockage in a coronary artery during or after a heart attack Blockage or narrowing of one or more coronary arteries that may lead to poor heart function (heart failure) Narrowings that reduce blood flow and cause persistent chest pain ( angina ) that medicines do not control Not every blockage can or needs to be treated with angioplasty.

Outlook (Prognosis) For infants, a blocked tear duct will most often go away on its own before the child is 1 year old. If not, the outcome is still likely to be good with probing. In adults, the outlook for a blocked tear duct varies, depending on the cause and how long the blockage has been present. Possible Complications Tear duct blockage may lead to an infection (dacryocystitis) in part of the nasolacrimal duct called the lacrimal sac. Most often, there is a bump on the side of the nose right next to the corner of the eye. Treatment for this often requires oral antibiotics. Sometimes, the sac needs to be surgically drained. Tear duct blockage can also increase the chance of other infections, such as conjunctivitis. When to Contact a Medical Professional See your provider if you have tear overflow onto the cheek.

This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or aren't functioning like they should. Hemophilia is caused by the lack of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. In most cases, hemophilia is passed down through families (inherited). Most of the time, it is passed to male children. Symptoms The main symptom of hemophilia is bleeding. Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild cases may not be detected until later in life, after excessive bleeding following surgery or an injury. Precautions may need to be taken before engaging in sports.

Most primary bleeding disorders can be managed. When the disorder is due to diseases, such as DIC, the outcome will depend on how well the underlying disease can be treated. Possible Complications Complications may include: Bleeding in the brain Severe bleeding (usually from the gastrointestinal tract or injuries) Other complications can occur, depending on the disorder. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you notice any unusual or severe bleeding. Prevention Prevention depends on the specific disorder. Alternative Names Coagulopathy Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Bleeding Disorders Title: Bleeding esophageal varices Causes Scarring ( cirrhosis ) of the liver is the most common cause of esophageal varices. This scarring cuts down on blood flowing through the liver. As a result, more blood flows through the veins of the esophagus. The extra blood flow causes the veins in the esophagus to balloon outward forming esophageal varices. Heavy bleeding can occur if the varices tear. Any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease can cause esophageal varices. Varices can also occur in the upper

bleeding into joints is common. Exams and Tests Most often, hemophilia is diagnosed after a person has an abnormal bleeding episode. It can also be diagnosed by a blood test done to detect the problem, if other family members have the condition. Treatment The most common treatment is to replace the missing clotting factor in the blood through a vein (intravenous infusions). Special care during surgery needs to be taken if you have this bleeding disorder. So, be sure to tell your surgeon that you have this disorder. It is also very important to share information about your disorder with blood relatives as they may also be affected. Support Groups Joining a support group where members share common issues can relieve the stress of a long-term (chronic) disease. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people with hemophilia are able to do normal activities. But some people have bleeding into the joints, which may limit their activity. A small number of people with hemophilia may die of severe bleeding.

a special type of CT scan that shows active bleeding into the intestine. Complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia. Colonoscopy. Stool test for occult (hidden) blood (a positive test result suggests bleeding from the colon). Treatment It is important to find the cause of bleeding in the colon and how fast the blood is being lost. You may need to be admitted to a hospital. Fluids may be given through a vein, and blood products may be required. Other treatment may be needed once the source of bleeding is found. In most cases, the bleeding stops on its own without treatment. If treatment is needed, it may involve: Angiography to help block the blood vessel that is bleeding or to deliver medicine to help cause the blood vessels to tighten to stop the bleeding. Burning (cauterizing) the site of the bleed with heat, argon plasma coagulation, or laser using a colonoscope. Medicines: A medicine called octreotide can be injected to help treat the problem. In some cases, surgery is the only option. You may need the entire right side of the colon (right hemicolectomy) removed if heavy bleeding continues, even after other treatments have been tried.

This is very important if you think there is internal bleeding. Internal bleeding can very quickly become life threatening. Immediate medical care is needed. Serious injuries may cause heavy bleeding. Sometimes, minor injuries can bleed a lot. An example is a scalp wound. You may bleed a lot if you take blood-thinning medicine or have a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia . Bleeding in such people requires medical attention right away. The most important step for external bleeding is to apply direct pressure. This will likely stop most external bleeding. Always wash your hands before (if possible) and after giving first aid to someone who is bleeding. This helps prevent infection. Try to use latex gloves when treating someone who is bleeding. Latex gloves should be in every first aid kit. People allergic to latex can use nonlatex gloves. You can catch infections, such as viral hepatitis or HIV/AIDS,

bleeding disorders are present at birth and are passed down through families (inherited). Others develop from: Illnesses, such as vitamin K deficiency or severe liver disease Treatments, such as the use of drugs to stop blood clots (anticoagulants) or the long-term use of antibiotics Bleeding disorders can also result from a problem with the number or function of platelets. These disorders can also be either inherited or develop later (acquired). The side effects of certain drugs often lead to the acquired forms. Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Bleeding into joints or muscles Bruising easily Heavy bleeding Heavy menstrual bleeding Nosebleeds that do not stop easily Excessive bleeding with surgical procedures Umbilical cord bleeding after birth The problems that occur depend on the specific bleeding disorder, and how severe it is.

The most common problems are blood diseases, including: Leukemia Lymphoma Severe anemia People who work with benzene products should only do so in areas with good air flow. They should also wear protective gloves and eye glasses. Title: Beriberi Causes There are two major types of beriberi: Wet beriberi: Affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome : Affects the nervous system. Beriberi is rare in the United States. This is because many foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in people who drink too much alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store vitamin B1. In rare cases, beriberi can be genetic. This condition is passed down through families. People with this condition lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time. The symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, this diagnosis is often missed. This is because health care providers may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics. Beriberi can occur in infants when they are: Breastfed and the mother's body is

lacking in thiamine Fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine Some medical treatments that can raise your risk of beriberi are: Getting dialysis Taking high doses of diuretics (water pills) Symptoms Symptoms of dry beriberi include: Difficulty walking Loss of feeling (sensation) in hands and feet Loss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs Mental confusion Pain Speech difficulties Strange eye movements (nystagmus) Tingling Vomiting Symptoms of wet beriberi include: Awakening at night short of breath Increased heart rate Shortness of breath with activity Swelling of the lower legs Exams and Tests A physical examination may show signs of congestive heart failure , including: Difficulty breathing, with neck veins that stick out Enlarged heart Fluid in the lungs Rapid heartbeat Swelling in both lower legs A person with late-stage beriberi may be confused or have memory loss and delusions. The person may be less able to sense vibrations.

Dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome : Affects the nervous system. Beriberi is rare in the United States. This is because many foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in people who drink too much alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store vitamin B1. In rare cases, beriberi can be genetic. This condition is passed down through families. People with this condition lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time. The symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, this diagnosis is often missed. This is because health care providers may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics. Beriberi can occur in infants when they are: Breastfed and the mother's body is

of treatment is to replace the thiamine your body is lacking. This is done with thiamine supplements. Thiamine supplements are given through a shot (injection) or taken by mouth. Your provider may also suggest other types of vitamins. Blood tests may be repeated after the treatment is started. These tests will show how well you are responding to the medicine. Outlook (Prognosis) Untreated, beriberi can be fatal. With treatment, symptoms usually improve quickly. Heart damage is usually reversible. A full recovery is expected in these cases. However, if acute heart failure has already occurred, the outlook is poor. Nervous system damage is also reversible, if caught early. If it is not caught early, some symptoms (such as memory loss or confusion) may remain, even with treatment. If a person with Wernicke encephalopathy receives thiamine replacement, language problems, unusual eye movements, and walking difficulties may go away. However, Korsakoff syndrome (or Korsakoff psychosis) may develop as Wernicke symptoms go away. Possible Complications Complications may include: Coma Congestive heart failure Death Psychosis When to Contact a Medical Professional Beriberi is extremely rare in the United States.

It is followed by another antibiotic (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) taken by mouth for up to 1 year. If symptoms come back during antibiotic use, the medicines may be changed. Your provider should closely follow your progress. Symptoms of the disease can return after you finish the treatments. People who remain malnourished will also need to take dietary supplements.

They may also cause periods to stop completely. PERMANENT METHODS OF BIRTH CONTROL These methods are best for men, women, and couples who feel certain they do not want to have children in the future. They include vasectomy and tubal ligation. These procedures can sometimes be reversed if a pregnancy is desired at a later time. However, the success rate for reversal is not high. BIRTH CONTROL METHODS THAT DO NOT WORK VERY WELL Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation can still result in pregnancy. Some semen often escapes before full withdrawal. It can be enough to cause a pregnancy. Douching shortly after sex is not likely to work. The sperm can make their way past the cervix within 90 seconds.

Symptoms A boil may begin as tender, pinkish-red, and swollen, on a firm area of the skin. Over time, it will feel like a water-filled balloon or cyst . Pain gets worse as it fills with pus and dead tissue. Pain lessens when the boil drains. A boil may drain on its own. More often, the boil needs to be opened to drain. The main symptoms of a boil include: A bump about the size of a pea, but may be as large as a golf ball White or yellow center ( pustules ) Spread to other skin areas or joining with other boils Quick growth Weeping, oozing, or crusting Other symptoms may include: Fatigue Fever General ill-feeling Itching before the boil develops Skin redness around the boil Exams and Tests The health care provider can usually diagnose a boil based on how it looks. A sample of cells from the boil may be sent to the lab for a culture to look for staphylococcus or other bacteria. Treatment Boils may heal on their own after a period of itching and mild pain.

What are the symptoms of Bladder cancer?,"testes, cervix, or uterus increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Bladder infection -- A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer. Research has not shown clear evidence that using artificial sweeteners leads to bladder cancer in humans. Symptoms Symptoms of bladder cancer can include: Abdominal pain Blood in the urine Bone pain or tenderness if the cancer spreads to the bone Fatigue Painful urination Urinary frequency and urgency Urine leakage (incontinence) Weight loss Other diseases and conditions can cause similar symptoms. It is important to see your health care provider to check for all other possible causes. Exams and Tests The provider will perform a physical examination , including a rectal and pelvic exam. Tests that may be done include: Abdominal and pelvic CT scan Abdominal MRI scan Cystoscopy (examining the inside of the bladder with a camera), with biopsy Intravenous pyelogram - IVP Urinalysis Urine cytology PET scan If tests confirm you have bladder cancer, additional tests will be done to see if the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Staging helps guide future treatment and follow-up and gives you some idea of what to expect in the future.

Test is Performed This test is most often done to check for cancer of the bladder or urethra. Normal Results The bladder wall is smooth. The bladder is of a normal size, shape, and position. There are no blockages , growths, or stones . What Abnormal Results Mean The presence of cancer cells indicates bladder cancer. The type of cancer can be determined from the biopsy sample. Other abnormalities may include: Bladder diverticula Cysts Inflammation Infection Ulcers Risks There is some risk for urinary tract infection (UTI). There is a slight risk for excessive bleeding. There may be a rupture of the bladder wall with the cystoscope or during biopsy. There is also a risk that the biopsy will fail to detect a serious condition. Considerations You will likely have a small amount of blood in your urine shortly after this procedure. If the bleeding continues after you urinate, contact your health care provider. Also contact your provider if: You have pain, chills, or a fever You are producing less urine than usual ( oliguria ) You cannot urinate despite a strong urge to do so Alternative Names Biopsy - bladder Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Biopsy Bladder Cancer Bladder Diseases

The TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) staging system is used to stage bladder cancer: Ta -- The cancer is in the lining of the bladder only and has not spread. T1 -- The cancer goes through the bladder lining, but does not reach the bladder muscle. T2 -- The cancer spreads to the bladder muscle. T3 -- The cancer spreads past the bladder into the fatty tissue surrounding it. T4 -- The cancer has spread to nearby structures such as the prostate gland, uterus, vagina, rectum, abdominal wall, or pelvic wall. Tumors are also grouped based on how they appear under a microscope. This is called grading the tumor. A high-grade tumor is fast growing and more likely to spread.

People with stage IV bladder cancer are rarely cured. Possible Complications Bladder cancers may spread into the nearby organs. They may also travel through the pelvic lymph nodes and spread to the liver, lungs, and bones. Additional complications of bladder cancer include: Anemia Swelling of the ureters ( hydronephrosis ) Urethral stricture Urinary incontinence Erectile dysfunction in men Sexual dysfunction in women When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have blood in your urine or other symptoms of bladder cancer, including: Frequent urination Painful urination Urgent need to urinate Prevention If you smoke, quit. Smoking can increase your risk for bladder cancer. Avoid exposure to chemicals linked to bladder cancer.

Title: Bladder cancer Causes Bladder cancer often starts from the cells lining the bladder. These cells are called transitional cells. These tumors are classified by the way they grow: Papillary tumors look like warts and are attached to a stalk. Carcinoma in situ tumors are flat. They are much less common. But they are more invasive and have a worse outcome. The exact cause of bladder cancer is not known. But several things that may make you more likely to develop it include: Cigarette smoking -- Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Up to half of all bladder cancers may be caused by cigarette smoke. Personal or family history of bladder cancer -- Having someone in the family with bladder cancer increases your risk of developing it. Chemical exposure -- Bladder cancer can be caused by coming into contact with cancer-causing chemicals (often at work). These chemicals are called carcinogens. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk. Chemotherapy -- The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide may increase the risk for bladder cancer. Radiation treatment -- Radiation therapy to the pelvis region for treatment of cancers of the prostate,

Surgery to remove the entire bladder (radical cystectomy) and nearby lymph nodes Surgery to remove only part of the bladder, followed by radiation and chemotherapy Chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before surgery or after surgery to reduce the risk of cancer from coming back A combination of chemotherapy and radiation (in people who choose not to have surgery or who cannot have surgery) Most people with stage IV tumors cannot be cured and surgery is not appropriate. In these people, chemotherapy, the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin (Padcev), targered therapy, and immunotherapy are often considered. CHEMOTHERAPY Chemotherapy may be given to people with stage II and III disease either before or after surgery to help prevent the tumor from returning. For early disease (stages 0 and I), chemotherapy is usually given directly into the bladder. IMMUNOTHERAPY Bladder cancers are often treated with immunotherapy. In this treatment, a medicine triggers your immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells. Immunotherapy for early stage bladder cancer is often performed using the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (commonly known as BCG). If the cancer returns after the use of BCG, newer agents may be used. As with all treatments, side effects are possible. Ask your

provider what side effects you might expect, and what to do if they occur. SURGERY Surgery for bladder cancer includes: Transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) -- Cancerous bladder tissue is removed through the urethra. Partial or complete removal of the bladder -- Many people with stage II or III bladder cancer may need to have their bladder removed (radical cystectomy). Sometimes, only part of the bladder is removed. Chemotherapy may be given before or after this surgery. Surgery may also be done to help your body drain urine after the bladder is removed. This may include: Ileal conduit -- A small urine reservoir is surgically created from a short piece of your small intestine. The ureters that drain urine from the kidneys are attached to one end of this piece. The other end is brought out through an opening in the skin (a stoma). The stoma allows the person to drain the collected urine out of the reservoir. Continent urinary reservoir -- A pouch to collect urine is created inside your body using a piece of your intestine. You will need to insert a tube into an opening in your skin (stoma) into this pouch to drain the urine.","Bladder cancer prevention measures include:

1. Quitting smoking as smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer.
2. Avoiding exposure to chemicals linked to bladder cancer, such as those encountered at work by dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators.
3. Following a provider's advice regarding medicines, including over-the-counter pain medicine.

Symptoms Sometimes, you may have a cold shortly before the symptoms of Bell palsy begin. Symptoms most often start suddenly, but may take 2 to 3 days to become fully developed. They do not become more severe after that. Symptoms are almost always on one side of the face only. They may range from mild to severe. Many people feel discomfort behind the ear before weakness is noticed. The face feels stiff or pulled to one side and may look different. Other signs can include: Difficulty closing one eye Difficulty eating and drinking because food falls out of one side of the mouth Drooling due to lack of control over the muscles of the face Slurring your words (dysarthria) due to lip weakness Drooping of the face, such as the eyelid or corner of the mouth Problems smiling, grimacing, or making facial expressions Twitching or weakness of the muscles in the face Other symptoms that may occur: Dry eye, which may lead to eye sores or infections Dry mouth Headache if there is an infection such as Lyme disease Loss of

Your provider may also suggest other types of vitamins. Blood tests may be repeated after the treatment is started. These tests will show how well you are responding to the medicine. Outlook (Prognosis) Untreated, beriberi can be fatal. With treatment, symptoms usually improve quickly. Heart damage is usually reversible. A full recovery is expected in these cases. However, if acute heart failure has already occurred, the outlook is poor. Nervous system damage is also reversible, if caught early. If it is not caught early, some symptoms (such as memory loss or confusion) may remain, even with treatment. If a person with Wernicke encephalopathy receives thiamine replacement, language problems, unusual eye movements, and walking difficulties may go away. However, Korsakoff syndrome (or Korsakoff psychosis) may develop as Wernicke symptoms go away. Possible Complications Complications may include: Coma Congestive heart failure Death Psychosis When to Contact a Medical Professional Beriberi is extremely rare in the United States. However, contact your provider if: You feel your family's diet is inadequate or poorly balanced You

narcolepsy, there is usually no need to have sleep studies done. Treatment In most cases, sleep paralysis occurs so rarely that treatment is not needed. If the cause is known, for example, due to lack of sleep, correcting the cause by getting enough sleep often resolves the condition. Sometimes, medicines that prevent REM during sleep are prescribed. In people with mental health conditions, such as anxiety, medicine and behavioral therapy (talk therapy) to help treat the mental health condition may resolve sleep paralysis.

What are the symptoms of Brucellosis?,"by the Brucella melitensis bacteria. People working in jobs where they often come in contact with animals or meat are at higher risk. This includes slaughterhouse workers, farmers, and veterinarians. Brucella is found in many countries worldwide including: Egypt Iraq Iran Jordan Saudi Arabia Chad Greece Mexico Symptoms Acute brucellosis may begin with mild flu-like symptoms, or symptoms such as: Abdominal pain Back pain Fever and chills Excessive sweating Fatigue Headache Joint and muscle pain Loss of appetite Swollen glands Weakness Weight loss High fever spikes often occur every afternoon. The name undulant fever is often used to describe this disease because the fever rises and falls in waves. The illness may be chronic and last for years. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. You'll also be asked if you've been in contact with animals or possibly eaten dairy products that were not pasteurized. Tests that may be done include: Blood test for brucellosis Blood culture Bone marrow culture Urine culture CSF (spinal fluid) culture Biopsy and culture of specimen from affected organ Treatment Antibiotics are used to treat the infection and prevent it from coming back. These include: Doxycycline Streptomycin

Serology for brucellosis How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test There is no special preparation. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed Brucellosis is an infection that occurs from coming into contact with animals that carry Brucella bacteria. Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of brucellosis. People who often come in contact with animals or meat are most likely to get this disease. This includes: Slaughterhouse workers Farmers Veterinarians Normal Results A normal (negative) result usually means you have not come in contact with the bacteria that causes brucellosis. However, this test may not detect the disease at an early stage. Your provider may have you come back for another test in 10 days to 3 weeks. Infection with other bacteria, such as Yersinia spp. , Francisella spp. , and Vibrio spp. , and certain immunizations can cause false-positive results. Normal value ranges may vary

throat, and breathing machine (ventilator) Chest x-ray ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Intravenous fluids (IV, or through a vein) Medicines to treat symptoms Outlook (Prognosis) With proper medical attention, survival past 48 hours is usually a sign that recovery will follow. Even with appropriate and quick treatment, symptoms may last for several days to weeks. The original bite, which may be small, may progress to a blood blister and look like a bull's eye. It may then become deeper, and additional symptoms such as fever, chills, and other signs of additional organ system involvement may develop. If scarring from an ulcer has developed, surgery may be needed to improve the appearance of the scar formed at the site of the bite. Death from brown recluse spider bites is more common in children than adults. Alternative Names Loxosceles reclusa Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Spider Bites Title: Brucellosis Causes Brucella can infect cattle, goats, camels, dogs, and pigs. The bacteria can spread to humans by: Coming in contact with infected meat or the placenta of infected animals Eating unpasteurized cheese Drinking unpasteurized milk Brucellosis is rare in the United States. About 100 to 200 cases occur each year. Most cases are caused

Gentamicin Rifampin Often, you need to take antibiotics for 6 weeks. If there are complications from brucellosis, you will likely need to take the medicines for a longer period. Outlook (Prognosis) Symptoms may come and go for years. Also, the illness can come back after a long period of not having symptoms. Possible Complications Health problems that may result from brucellosis include: Bone and joint infection and damage Encephalitis (swelling or inflammation of the brain) Infective endocarditis (inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and heart valves) Meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if: You develop symptoms of brucellosis Your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment You develop new symptoms after treatment for brucellosis Prevention Drinking and eating only pasteurized dairy products, such as milk and cheeses, is the most important way to reduce the risk for brucellosis. People who handle meat should wear protective eyewear and clothing and protect skin breaks from infection. Detecting infected animals controls the infection at its source. Vaccination is available for cattle, but not humans. Alternative Names Cyprus fever; Undulant fever; Gibraltar

People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk of developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Europeans. People with celiac disease are more likely to have: Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus , and Sjögren syndrome Addison disease Down syndrome Intestinal cancer Intestinal lymphoma Lactose intolerance Thyroid disease Type 1 diabetes Symptoms The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. This can make diagnosis difficult. For example, one person may have constipation, a second may have diarrhea, and a third may have no problem with stools. Gastrointestinal symptoms include: Abdominal pain , bloating, gas, or indigestion Constipation Decreased appetite (may also be increased or unchanged) Diarrhea , either constant or off and on Lactose intolerance (common when the person is diagnosed, often goes away after treatment) Nausea and vomiting Stools that are foul smelling, oily, or stick to the toilet when flushed Unexplained weight loss (although people can be overweight or normal weight) Other problems that can develop over time because the intestines do not absorb key nutrients include: Easy bruising Depression or anxiety Fatigue

Carotid angioplasty and stenting -- This procedure opens a blocked artery and places a tiny wire mesh (stent) in the artery to keep it open. Outlook (Prognosis) Because there are no symptoms, you may not know you have carotid artery disease until you have a stroke or TIA. Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Some people who have a stroke recover most or all of their functions. Others die of the stroke itself or from complications. About one half of people who have a stroke have long-term problems. Possible Complications Major complications of carotid artery disease are: Transient ischemic attack. This occurs when a blot clot briefly blocks a blood vessel to the brain. It causes the same symptoms as stroke. Symptoms last only a few minutes to an hour or two, but no longer than 24 hours.

- cardioversion; Arrhythmia - cardioversion; Cardiac arrest - cardioversion; Defibrillator - cardioversion; Pharmacologic cardioversion Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Arrhythmia Title: Carotid artery disease Causes Carotid artery disease occurs when fatty material called plaque builds up inside the arteries. This buildup of plaque is called hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ). The plaque may slowly block or narrow the carotid artery. Or it may cause a clot to form suddenly. A clot that blocks the artery enough to reduce blood flow can lead to stroke . Risk factors for blockage or narrowing of the arteries include: Smoking (people who smoke one pack a day double their risk for stroke) Diabetes High blood pressure High cholesterol and triglycerides Older age Family history of stroke or blood vessel disorder Alcohol use Recreational drug use Trauma to the neck area, which may cause a tear in the carotid artery Radiation therapy to the neck Symptoms At early stages, you may not have any symptoms. After plaque builds up, the first symptoms of carotid artery disease may be a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is temporary reduction in blood flow to the brain that doesn't cause any lasting damage. Symptoms

will tell your provider how open or narrowed your carotid arteries are. For example, the arteries may be 10% narrowed, 50% narrowed, or 75% narrowed. A normal result means there is no problem with the blood flow in the carotid arteries. The artery is free of any significant blockage, narrowing, or other problem. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal result means the artery may be narrowed, or something is changing the blood flow in the carotid arteries. This is a sign of atherosclerosis or other blood vessel conditions. In general, the more narrowed the artery is, the higher your risk for stroke. Depending on the results, your provider may want you to: Consider treatment with medicines or� surgery Have additional tests (such as cerebral angiography , CT angiography , and magnetic resonance angiography ) Follow a healthy diet and lifestyle to prevent hardening of the arteries Repeat the test again in the future Risks There are no risks with having this procedure.

Your provider may use a stethoscope to listen to the blood flow in your neck for an unusual sound called a bruit. This sound may be a sign of carotid artery disease. Your provider also may find clots in the blood vessels of your eye. If you have had a stroke or TIA, a nervous system (neurological) exam will show other problems. You may also have the following tests: Blood cholesterol and triglycerides test Blood sugar (glucose) test Ultrasound of the carotid arteries ( carotid duplex ultrasound ) to see how well blood is flowing through the carotid artery The following imaging tests may be used to examine the blood vessels in the neck and brain: Cerebral angiography CT angiography MR angiography Transcranial Doppler ultrasound Treatment Treatment options include: Blood-thinning medicines such as aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), warfarin (Coumadin),","The symptoms of carotid artery disease may not be present at early stages.

on your neck over your carotid artery. A flexible tube (catheter) is put in the artery. Blood flows through the catheter around the blocked area during surgery. Your carotid artery is opened. The surgeon removes the plaque inside the artery. After the plaque is removed, the artery is closed with stitches or a patch from one of your veins or synthetic material. Blood now flows through the artery to your brain. Your heart activity is monitored closely during surgery. The surgery takes about 2 hours. After the procedure, your surgeon may do a test to confirm that the artery has been opened. Why the Procedure is Performed This procedure is done if your health care provider has found narrowing or a blockage in your carotid artery. Your provider will have done one or more tests to see how much the carotid artery is blocked. Surgery to remove the buildup in your carotid artery may be done if the artery is narrowed by more than 70%. If you have had a stroke or temporary brain injury, your provider will consider whether treating your blocked artery with surgery is safe for you. Other treatment options your provider will discuss with you are:

No treatment, other than tests to check your carotid artery every year. Medicine and diet to lower your cholesterol. Blood-thinning medicines to lower your risk for stroke. Some of these medicines are aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), dabigatran (Pradaxa), and warfarin (Coumadin). Carotid angioplasty and stenting is likely to be used when carotid endarterectomy would not be safe.

Carotid angioplasty and stenting -- This procedure opens a blocked artery and places a tiny wire mesh (stent) in the artery to keep it open. Outlook (Prognosis) Because there are no symptoms, you may not know you have carotid artery disease until you have a stroke or TIA. Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Some people who have a stroke recover most or all of their functions. Others die of the stroke itself or from complications. About one half of people who have a stroke have long-term problems. Possible Complications Major complications of carotid artery disease are: Transient ischemic attack. This occurs when a blot clot briefly blocks a blood vessel to the brain. It causes the same symptoms as stroke. Symptoms last only a few minutes to an hour or two, but no longer than 24 hours.

This buildup of plaque is called hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ). The plaque may slowly block or narrow the carotid artery. Or it may cause a clot to form suddenly. A clot that blocks the artery enough to reduce blood flow can lead to stroke . Risk factors for blockage or narrowing of the arteries include: Smoking (people who smoke one pack a day double their risk for stroke) Diabetes High blood pressure High cholesterol and triglycerides Older age Family history of stroke or blood vessel disorder Alcohol use Recreational drug use Trauma to the neck area, which may cause a tear in the carotid artery Radiation therapy to the neck Symptoms At early stages, you may not have any symptoms. After plaque builds up, the first symptoms of carotid artery disease may be a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is temporary reduction in blood flow to the brain that doesn't cause any lasting damage. Symptoms

on your neck over your carotid artery. A flexible tube (catheter) is put in the artery. Blood flows through the catheter around the blocked area during surgery. Your carotid artery is opened. The surgeon removes the plaque inside the artery. After the plaque is removed, the artery is closed with stitches or a patch from one of your veins or synthetic material. Blood now flows through the artery to your brain. Your heart activity is monitored closely during surgery. The surgery takes about 2 hours. After the procedure, your surgeon may do a test to confirm that the artery has been opened. Why the Procedure is Performed This procedure is done if your health care provider has found narrowing or a blockage in your carotid artery. Your provider will have done one or more tests to see how much the carotid artery is blocked. Surgery to remove the buildup in your carotid artery may be done if the artery is narrowed by more than 70%. If you have had a stroke or temporary brain injury, your provider will consider whether treating your blocked artery with surgery is safe for you. Other treatment options your provider will discuss with you are:

Do not drink more than 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks a day. Exercise regularly: 30 minutes a day if you are not overweight; 60 to 90 minutes a day if you are overweight. Quit smoking . Most people should aim for a blood pressure below 120 to 130/80 mm Hg. If you have diabetes or have had a stroke, your provider may tell you to aim for a lower blood pressure. If you have diabetes, heart disease, or hardening of the arteries, your LDL (bad) cholesterol should be lower than 70 mg/dL. Some experts recommend an even lower target, below 55 mg/dL. Follow your provider's treatment plans if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease. Your provider may also recommend: No treatment. You may only need regular visits to check the health of your heart and carotid arteries. Aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or other blood-thinning medicines to lower your risk for stroke. If a large part of the carotid artery appears blocked, carotid endarterectomy surgery is done to remove the blockage.","Carotid artery disease can be prevented or managed with the following steps:

1. Healthy Diet: Follow a healthy, low-fat diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Limit intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars.

2. Regular Exercise: Engage in regular physical activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week, or 60 to 90 minutes if you are overweight.

What are the symptoms of Chickenpox?,"old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox. Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well. Symptoms Most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears: Fever Headache Stomach ache The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin. The blisters are most often first seen on the face, middle of the body, or scalp. After a day or two, the blisters become cloudy and then scab. Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups. They often appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids. Children with skin problems, such as eczema, may get thousands of blisters. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria that is made more likely by scratching. Some children who have had the vaccine will still develop a

About 1 in 10 adults will have shingles when the virus re-emerges during a period of stress. Possible Complications Rarely, infection of the brain has occurred. Other problems may include: Reye syndrome Infection of the heart muscle Pneumonia Joint pain or swelling Cerebellar ataxia may appear during the recovery phase or later. This involves a very unsteady walk. Women who get chickenpox during pregnancy can pass the infection to the developing baby. Newborns are at risk for severe infection. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you think that your child has chickenpox or if your child is over 12 months of age and has not been vaccinated against chickenpox. Prevention Because chickenpox is airborne and spreads very easily, even before the rash appears, it is hard to avoid. A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule. The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild. Talk to your provider if you think your child might be at high risk for complications and might have been exposed.

Antiviral medicines are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early. Antiviral medicine may be very important for those who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids. Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. DO NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reye syndrome . Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used.

What are the symptoms of Cancer?,"of all cancers that spread through the body. They are much more common than primary brain tumors (tumors that start in the brain). Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Decreased coordination , clumsiness, falls General ill feeling or fatigue Headache , new or more severe than usual Memory loss, poor judgment, difficulty solving problems Numbness, tingling, pain, and other changes in sensation Personality changes Rapid emotional changes or strange behaviors Seizures that are new Problems with speech Vision changes , double vision, decreased vision Vomiting, with or without nausea Weakness of a body area Specific symptoms vary. Common symptoms of most types of metastatic brain tumors are caused by increased pressure in the brain. Exams and Tests An exam can show brain and nervous system changes based on where the tumor is in the brain. Signs of increased pressure in the skull are also common. Some tumors may not show signs until they are very large. Then, they can cause a very quick decline in nervous system function. The original (primary) tumor may be found by examining tumor tissues from the brain. Tests may include: Mammogram , CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to find the

In US men, other than skin cancer, the three most common cancers are: Prostate cancer Lung cancer Colorectal cancer In US women, other than skin cancer, the three most common cancers are: Breast cancer Lung cancer Colorectal cancer Some cancers are more common in certain parts of the world. For example, in Japan, there are many cases of stomach cancer . But in the United States this type of cancer is much less common. Differences in diet or environmental factors may play a role. Some other types of cancer include: Brain cancer Cervical cancer Hodgkin lymphoma Kidney cancer Leukemia Liver cancer Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Ovarian cancer Pancreatic cancer Testicular cancer Thyroid cancer Uterine cancer Symptoms Symptoms of cancer depend on the type and location of the cancer. For example, lung cancer can cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Colon cancer may cause diarrhea, constipation, or blood in the stool. Some cancers may not have any symptoms. In certain cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, symptoms often do not start until the disease has reached an advanced stage. The following symptoms may occur

Common tests include the following: Biopsy of the tumor Blood tests� (which look for chemicals called tumor markers that can be elevated or abnormal with certain types of cancer) Bone marrow biopsy (for lymphoma or leukemia) Chest x-ray Complete blood count (CBC) CT scan Liver function lab tests MRI scan PET scan Most cancers are diagnosed by biopsy. Depending on the location of the tumor, the biopsy may be a simple procedure or a serious operation. Most people with cancer have CT scans to determine the exact location and size of the tumor or tumors. A cancer diagnosis is often difficult to cope with. It is important that you discuss the type, size, and location of the cancer with your health care provider when you are diagnosed. You also will want to ask about treatment options, along with the prognosis (likely outcome), benefits, and risks. It's a good idea to have someone with you at the provider's office to help you get through and understand the diagnosis.

What is the treatment for Cancer?,"for certain tumors. The following are treatments for specific types of tumors: Astrocytoma: Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be needed. Brainstem gliomas: Surgery may not be possible because of the tumor's location deep in the brain. Radiation is used to shrink the tumor and prolong life. Sometimes targeted chemotherapy can be used. Ependymomas: Treatment includes surgery. Radiation and chemotherapy may be necessary. Medulloblastomas: Surgery alone does not cure this type of tumor. Chemotherapy with or without radiation is often used in combination with surgery. Medicines used to treat children with primary brain tumors include: Corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling Diuretics (water pills) to reduce brain swelling and pressure Anticonvulsants to reduce or prevent seizures Pain medicines Chemotherapy to help shrink the tumor or prevent the tumor from growing back Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other such steps may be required to improve quality of life. Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you and your child feel less alone. Outlook (Prognosis) How well a child does

If you have trouble asking questions after hearing about your diagnosis, the person you bring with you can ask them for you. Treatment Treatment varies, based on the type of cancer and its stage. The stage of a cancer refers to how much it has grown and whether the tumor has spread from its original location. If the cancer is in one location and has not spread, the most common treatment approach is surgery to cure the cancer. This is often the case with skin cancers, as well as cancers of the lung, breast, and colon. If the tumor has spread to local lymph nodes only, sometimes these can also be removed with the tumor. If surgery cannot remove all of the cancer, the options for treatment may include radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , targeted cancer therapies , or other types of treatment. Some cancers require a combination of treatments. Lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph glands, is rarely treated with surgery. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and other nonsurgical therapies are often used. Although treatment for cancer can be difficult, there are many ways to keep up your strength. If you have radiation treatment: Treatment is usually scheduled every

Radiation may be used to: Treat the cancer, sometimes along with chemotherapy, if surgery is not possible Help relieve symptoms caused by the cancer, such as breathing problems and swelling Help relieve cancer pain when the cancer has spread to the bones Controlling symptoms during and after radiation to the chest is an important part of care. The following treatments are mostly used to relieve symptoms caused by NSCLC: Laser therapy -- A small beam of light burns and kills cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy -- Uses a light to activate a medicine in the body, which then kills cancer cells. Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook varies. Most often, NSCLC grows slowly. In some cases, it can grow and spread quickly and cause rapid death. The cancer may spread to other parts of the body, including the bone, liver, small intestine, and brain. Chemotherapy , immunotherapy , and targeted therapy have been shown to prolong life and improve the quality of life in some people with stage IV NSCLC.

size and type of tumor and your general health. Goals of treatment may be to cure the tumor, relieve symptoms, and improve brain function or comfort. Surgery is often needed for most primary brain tumors. Some tumors may be completely removed. Those that are deep inside the brain or that enter brain tissue may be debulked instead of removed. Debulking is a procedure to reduce the tumor's size. Tumors can be hard to remove completely by surgery alone. This is because the tumor invades surrounding brain tissue much like roots from a plant spread through soil. When the tumor cannot be removed, surgery may still help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms. Radiation therapy is used for certain tumors. Chemotherapy may be used with surgery or radiation treatment. Other medicines used to treat primary brain tumors may include: Medicines to reduce brain swelling and pressure Anticonvulsants to reduce seizures Pain medicines Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, and occupational therapy may be needed to improve quality of life. Counseling, support groups, and similar measures can help people cope with the disorder. You may consider enrolling in a clinical trial after talking with your treatment team. Possible Complications Complications that may result

surgeon may remove: One of the lobes of the lung (lobectomy) Only a small part of the lung (wedge or segment removal) The entire lung (pneumonectomy) Some people need chemotherapy . Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells and stop new cells from growing. Treatment may be done in the following ways: Chemotherapy is often used when the cancer has spread outside the lung (stage IV). It may also be given before surgery. This is called neoadjuvant therapy. It may be given after surgery to kill any remaining cancer. This is called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy is usually given through a vein (by IV). Controlling symptoms and preventing complications during and after chemotherapy is an important part of care. Immunotherapy � can be given by itself or with chemotherapy. Targeted therapy may be used to treat NSCLC. Targeted therapy uses medicines to zero in on specific target molecules in or on cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the medicine disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. Radiation therapy can be used with chemotherapy if surgery is not possible. Radiation therapy uses powerful x-rays or other forms of radiation to","The treatment for cancer varies based on the type, size, and stage of the cancer, as well as the patient's general health. Common treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted cancer therapies, or a combination of these.

The most common treatment approach for cancers that are in one location and have not spread is surgery to cure the cancer.

The stage refers to how much the cancer has grown and whether it has spread from its original location. Here are some common treatments:

1. **Surgery**: If the cancer is in one location and hasn't spread, surgery may be used to remove the tumor. This is often the case with skin cancers, as well as cancers of the lung, breast, and colon. If the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes, these may also be removed.

2. **Radiation Therapy**: This uses powerful x-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells. It may be used to treat the cancer, relieve symptoms, or help with pain.

3. **Chemotherapy**: This uses medicines to kill cancer cells and stop new cells from growing. It's often used when the cancer has spread or to shrink the tumor before or after surgery.

4. **Immunotherapy**: This helps your immune system fight cancer. It can be given alone or with chemotherapy.

5. **Targeted Therapy**: This uses medicines to target specific molecules in or on cancer cells to stop them from growing and spreading.

Some cancers require a combination of these treatments. Also, other types of treatment may be used, such as hormone therapy or stem cell transplants.

Alternative Names Deerfly fever; Rabbit fever; Pahvant Valley plague; Ohara disease; Yato-byo (Japan); Lemming fever Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Animal Diseases and Your Health Bacterial Infections Tick Bites Title: Tumor Causes In general, tumors occur when cells divide and grow excessively in the body. Normally, the body controls cell growth and division. New cells are created to replace older ones or to perform new functions. Cells that are damaged or no longer needed die to make room for healthy replacements. If the balance of cell growth and death is disturbed, a tumor may form. Problems with the body's immune system can lead to tumors. Tobacco causes more deaths from cancer than any other environmental substance. Other risk factors for cancer include: Benzene and other chemicals and toxins Drinking too much alcohol Environmental toxins, such as certain poisonous mushrooms and a type of poison that can grow on peanut plants (aflatoxins) Excessive sunlight exposure Genetic problems Obesity Radiation exposure Viruses Types of tumors known to be caused by or

The cancer may spread. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of cancer. Prevention You can reduce the risk of getting a cancerous (malignant) tumor by: Eating healthy foods Exercising regularly Limiting alcohol Maintaining a healthy weight Minimizing your exposure to radiation and toxic chemicals Not smoking or chewing tobacco Reducing sun exposure, especially if you burn easily Cancer screenings, such as mammography for breast cancer and stool blood testing or colonoscopy for colon cancer, may help catch these cancers at their early stages when they are most treatable.

Outlook (Prognosis) A cure is unlikely in most cases of cancers that have spread to the lungs. But the outlook depends on the main cancer. In some cases, a person can live more than 5 years with metastatic cancer to the lungs. Possible Complications Complications of metastatic tumors in the lungs may include: Fluid between the lung and chest wall ( pleural effusion ), which can cause shortness of breath or pain when taking a deep breath Further spread of the cancer When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have a history of cancer and you develop: Coughing up blood Persistent cough Shortness of breath Unexplained weight loss Prevention Not all cancers can be prevented. However, many can be prevented by: Eating healthy foods Exercising regularly Limiting alcohol consumption Not smoking

kill cancer cells. Radiation may be used to: Treat the cancer, sometimes along with chemotherapy, if surgery is not possible Help relieve symptoms caused by the cancer, such as breathing problems and swelling Help relieve cancer pain when the cancer has spread to the bones Controlling symptoms during and after radiation to the chest is an important part of care. The following treatments are mostly used to relieve symptoms caused by NSCLC: Laser therapy -- A small beam of light burns and kills cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy -- Uses a light to activate a medicine in the body, which then kills cancer cells. Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook varies. Most often, NSCLC grows slowly. In some cases, it can grow and spread quickly and cause rapid death. The cancer may spread to other parts of the body, including the bone, liver, small intestine, and brain. Chemotherapy , immunotherapy , and targeted therapy have been shown to prolong life and improve the quality of life in some people with stage IV NSCLC.

Normal cells multiply when the body needs them, and die when they are damaged or the body doesn't need them. Cancer occurs when the genetic material of a cell becomes changed. This results in cells growing out of control. Cells divide too quickly and do not die in a normal way. There are many kinds of cancer. Cancer can develop in almost any organ or tissue, such as the lung, colon, breast, skin, bones, or nerve tissue. There are many risk factors for cancer, including: Smoking tobacco or other substances Chewing tobacco Benzene and other chemical exposures Drinking too much alcohol Environmental toxins, such as certain poisonous mushrooms and a type of mold that can grow on peanut plants and produce a toxin called aflatoxin Genetic problems Obesity Radiation exposure Too much sunlight exposure Viruses The cause of many cancers remains unknown. The most common cause","Cancer can be reduced in risk by several preventive measures:

1. Eating healthy foods: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can help reduce the risk of cancer.

2. Exercising regularly: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of cancer.

3. Limiting alcohol: Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of certain cancers, so it's recommended to limit alcohol intake.

4. Maintaining a healthy weight: Obesity is linked to an increased risk of many types of cancer, so maintaining a healthy weight is important.

5. Minimizing exposure to radiation and toxic","You can reduce the risk of getting cancer by:

It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed right after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given medicines to break up the clot. This is

blood. It makes the heart walls thin so they do not pump well. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a group of disorders. The heart chambers are unable to fill with blood because the heart muscle is stiff. The most common causes of this type of cardiomyopathy are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause. Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs during pregnancy or in the first 5 months afterward. Treatment When possible, the cause of cardiomyopathy is treated. Medicines and lifestyle changes are often needed to treat the symptoms of heart failure, angina and abnormal heart rhythms .

Alternative Names IVUS; Ultrasound - coronary artery; Endovascular ultrasound; Intravascular echocardiography Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Heart Health Tests Title: Cardiac tamponade Causes In this condition, blood or fluid collects in the sac surrounding the heart. This prevents the heart ventricles from expanding fully. The excess pressure from the fluid prevents the heart from working properly. As a result, the body does not get enough blood. Cardiac tamponade can occur due to: Dissecting aortic aneurysm (thoracic) End-stage lung cancer Heart attack ( acute MI ) Heart surgery Pericarditis caused by bacterial or viral infections Wounds to the heart Other possible causes include: Heart tumors Underactive thyroid gland Kidney failure Leukemia Placement of central lines Radiation therapy to the chest Recent invasive heart procedures Systemic lupus erythematosus Dermatomyositis Heart failure Cardiac tamponade due to disease occurs in about 2 out of 10,000 people. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Anxiety , restlessness Breathing problems Sharp chest pain that is felt in the neck, shoulder, back, or abdomen Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing or coughing Problems breathing Discomfort, sometimes relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward Fainting , lightheadedness Pale, gray, or blue skin Palpitations Rapid

breathing Swelling of the legs or abdomen Jaundice Other symptoms that may occur with this disorder: Dizziness Drowsiness Weak or absent pulse Exams and Tests Echocardiogram is the test of choice to help make the diagnosis. This test may be done at the bedside in emergency cases. A physical exam may show: Blood pressure that falls when breathing deeply Rapid breathing Heart rate over 100 (normal is 60 to 100 beats per minute) Heart sounds are only faintly heard through a stethoscope Neck veins that may be bulging (distended) but the blood pressure is low Weak or absent peripheral pulses Other tests may include: Chest CT or MRI of chest Chest x-ray Coronary angiography ECG Right heart catheterization Treatment Cardiac tamponade is an emergency condition that needs to be treated in the hospital. The fluid around the heart must be drained as quickly as possible. A procedure that uses a needle to remove fluid from the tissue that surrounds the heart will be done. A surgical procedure to cut and remove part of the covering of the heart may also be done. This is known as surgical pericardiectomy or pericardial window. Fluids are given to keep blood pressure normal until

shock is delivered to your heart. This shock briefly stops all electrical activity of the heart. Then it allows the normal heart rhythm to return. Sometimes more than one shock, or a shock with higher energy is needed. An external defibrillator is used to treat abnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmia ) that cause collapse and cardiac arrest. Examples are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. These same devices may also be used to treat less dangerous abnormal rhythms, problems such as atrial fibrillation. Some people may need to start blood thinners beforehand to prevent small blood clots. You will be given medicine to help you relax before the procedure. After the procedure, you may be given medicines to prevent blood clots or to help prevent the arrhythmia from coming back. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that is placed inside your body. It is most often used in people who are at risk for sudden death because their heart function is so poor, or they have had dangerous heart rhythms before. The ICD is implanted underneath the skin of your upper chest or abdomen. Wires are attached that go into or near the heart. If the device detects a dangerous

blood. It makes the heart walls thin so they do not pump well. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a group of disorders. The heart chambers are unable to fill with blood because the heart muscle is stiff. The most common causes of this type of cardiomyopathy are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause. Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs during pregnancy or in the first 5 months afterward. Treatment When possible, the cause of cardiomyopathy is treated. Medicines and lifestyle changes are often needed to treat the symptoms of heart failure, angina and abnormal heart rhythms . Procedures or surgeries may also be used, including: A defibrillator that sends an electrical pulse to stop life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms A pacemaker that treats a slow heart rate or helps the heart beat in a more coordinated fashion Coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery or angioplasty that may improve blood flow to the damaged or weakened heart muscle Heart transplant that may be tried when all other treatments have failed Partially and fully implantable mechanical heart pumps have been developed. These may be used for very severe cases. However, not all people need this advanced treatment. Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on many different","Many cases of Cardiac tamponade can't be prevented as they are often caused by underlying heart conditions or complications from heart procedures, infections, or diseases. However, knowing one's personal risk factors may help in early diagnosis and treatment, potentially reducing the risk of developing Cardiac tamponade. This includes being aware of symptoms such as chest pain, breathing problems, swelling, and anxiety, and seeking immediate medical attention if they occur.

Over time, these proteins replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis (""stiff heart syndrome"") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical type of restrictive cardiomyopathy . Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical signals move through the heart (conduction system). This can lead to abnormal heartbeats ( arrhythmias ) and faulty heart signals (heart block). The condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation. Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40.

Symptoms Some people may have no symptoms. When present, symptoms may include: Excessive urination at night Fatigue, reduced exercise ability Palpitations (sensation of feeling heartbeat) Shortness of breath with activity Swelling of the abdomen, legs, ankles, or other part of the body Trouble breathing while lying down Exams and Tests The signs of cardiac amyloidosis can be related to a number of different conditions. This can make the problem hard to diagnose. Signs may include: Abnormal sounds in the lung (lung crackles) or a heart murmur Blood pressure that is low or drops when you stand up Enlarged neck veins Swollen liver The following tests may be done: Blood and urine protein tests Chest or abdomen CT scan (considered the ""gold standard"" to help diagnose this condition) Coronary angiography Echocardiogram Electrocardiogram (ECG) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Nuclear heart scans (MUGA, RNV) Positron emission tomography (PET) An ECG may show problems with the heartbeat or heart signals.

What are the symptoms of Choanal atresia?,"Chlorpromazine is fairly safe. Most likely, an overdose will only cause drowsiness and some side effects such as uncontrolled movements of the lips, eyes, head, and neck for a short time. These movements may continue if they are not treated quickly and correctly. In rare cases, an overdose can cause more serious symptoms. Nervous system symptoms may be permanent. The most serious side effects are usually due to damage to the heart. If heart damage can be stabilized, recovery is likely. Life threatening heart rhythm disturbances may be difficult to treat, and may result in death. Survival past 2 days is usually a good sign. Title: Choanal atresia Causes The cause of choanal atresia is unknown. It is thought to occur when the thin tissue separating the nose and mouth area during fetal development remains after birth. The condition is the most common nasal abnormality in newborn infants. Females get this condition about twice as often as males. More than half of affected infants also have other congenital problems. Choanal atresia is most often diagnosed shortly after birth while the infant is still in the hospital. Symptoms Newborns generally prefer to breathe through their nose. Typically, infants only breathe through

their mouths when they cry. Babies with choanal atresia have difficulty breathing unless they are crying. Choanal atresia may affect one or both sides of the nasal airway. Choanal atresia blocking both sides of the nose causes acute breathing problems with bluish discoloration and breathing failure. Such infants may need resuscitation at delivery. More than one half of infants have a blockage on only one side, which causes less severe problems. Symptoms include: Chest retracts unless the child is breathing through mouth or crying. Difficulty breathing following birth, which may result in cyanosis (bluish discoloration), unless infant is crying. Inability to nurse and breathe at same time. Inability to pass a catheter through each side of the nose into the throat. Persistent one-sided nasal blockage or discharge. Exams and Tests A physical exam may show an obstruction of the nose. Tests that may be done include: CT scan Endoscopy of the nose Sinus x-ray Treatment The immediate concern is to resuscitate the baby if necessary. An airway may need to be placed so that the infant can breathe. In some cases, intubation may be needed. An infant can learn to mouth breathe, which can delay the need for immediate surgery.

Life threatening heart rhythm disturbances may be difficult to treat, and may result in death. Survival past 2 days is usually a good sign. Title: Choanal atresia Causes The cause of choanal atresia is unknown. It is thought to occur when the thin tissue separating the nose and mouth area during fetal development remains after birth. The condition is the most common nasal abnormality in newborn infants. Females get this condition about twice as often as males. More than half of affected infants also have other congenital problems. Choanal atresia is most often diagnosed shortly after birth while the infant is still in the hospital. Symptoms Newborns generally prefer to breathe through their nose. Typically, infants only breathe through

their mouths when they cry. Babies with choanal atresia have difficulty breathing unless they are crying. Choanal atresia may affect one or both sides of the nasal airway. Choanal atresia blocking both sides of the nose causes acute breathing problems with bluish discoloration and breathing failure. Such infants may need resuscitation at delivery. More than one half of infants have a blockage on only one side, which causes less severe problems. Symptoms include: Chest retracts unless the child is breathing through mouth or crying. Difficulty breathing following birth, which may result in cyanosis (bluish discoloration), unless infant is crying. Inability to nurse and breathe at same time. Inability to pass a catheter through each side of the nose into the throat. Persistent one-sided nasal blockage or discharge. Exams and Tests A physical exam may show an obstruction of the nose. Tests that may be done include: CT scan Endoscopy of the nose Sinus x-ray Treatment The immediate concern is to resuscitate the baby if necessary. An airway may need to be placed so that the infant can breathe. In some cases, intubation may be needed. An infant can learn to mouth breathe, which can delay the need for immediate surgery.

atresia can be repaired. Your baby may also need continuous or frequent suction to clear secretions from the upper esophagus. While your baby is in the hospital, the care team will show you how to use and replace the G-tube. You may also be sent home with an extra G-tube. The hospital staff will inform a home health supply company of your equipment needs. How long your infant stays in the hospital depends on the type of defect your child has and whether there are other problems in addition to the TEF and EA. You will be able to bring your baby home once they are taking feedings by mouth or gastrostomy tube, is gaining weight, and safely breathing on their own. Outlook (Prognosis) Surgery can usually repair a TEF and EA. Once healing from the surgery is complete, your child may have these problems: The part of the esophagus that was repaired may become narrower. Your child may need to have more surgery to treat this. Your child may have heartburn, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This occurs when acid from the stomach goes up into the esophagus. GERD may cause breathing problems. During infancy and early childhood, many

carefully notes the infant's temperature, vital signs, and responses to the light. They also note how long the treatment lasted and the position of the light bulbs. The baby may become dehydrated from the lights. Fluids may be given through a vein during treatment. Blood tests are done to check the bilirubin level. When the level has dropped enough, phototherapy is complete. Some infants receive phototherapy at home. In this case, a nurse visits daily and draws a sample of blood for testing. Treatment depends on 3 things: Gestational age Bilirubin level in the blood Newborn's age (in hours) In severe cases of increased bilirubin, an exchange transfusion may be done instead. Alternative Names Phototherapy for jaundice; Bilirubin - bili lights; Neonatal care - bili lights; Newborn care - bili lights Patient Instructions Newborn jaundice - discharge Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Jaundice Title: Biliary atresia Causes Biliary atresia occurs when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver are abnormally narrow, blocked, or absent. The bile ducts carry a digestive fluid from liver to small bowel to break down fats and filter out waste from the body. The cause of the disease is not clear. It may be due to:

to check total and direct bilirubin levels Hepatobiliary scintigraphy or HIDA scan to check whether the bile ducts and gallbladder are working properly Liver biopsy to check the severity of cirrhosis or to rule out other causes of jaundice X-ray of the bile ducts (cholangiogram) to check if the bile ducts are opened or closed Treatment An operation called the Kasai procedure is done to connect the liver to the small intestine. The abnormal ducts are bypassed. The surgery is more successful if done before the baby is 8 weeks old. Liver transplant may still be needed before 20 years of age in most of the cases. Outlook (Prognosis) Early surgery will improve the survival of more than one third of babies with this condition. The long-term benefit of a� liver transplant is not yet known, but it is expected to improve survival. Possible Complications Complications may include: Infection Irreversible cirrhosis Liver failure Surgical complications, including failure of the Kasai procedure When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if your child appears jaundiced, or if other symptoms of biliary atresia develop.

What are the symptoms of Charcot foot?,"leading to foot damage include: Blood vessel damage from diabetes can increase or change blood flow to the feet. This can lead to bone loss. Weakened bones in the feet increase the risk of fracture. Injury to the foot signals the body to produce more inflammation-causing chemicals. This contributes to swelling and bone loss. Symptoms Early foot symptoms may include: Mild pain and discomfort Redness Swelling Warmth in the affected foot (noticeably warmer than the other foot) At later stages, bones in the foot break and move out of place, causing the foot or ankle to become deformed. A classic sign of Charcot is rocker-bottom foot. This occurs when the bones in middle of the foot collapse. This causes the arch of the foot to collapse and bow downward. The toes may curl downward. Bones that stick out at odd angles can lead to pressure sores and foot ulcers . Because the feet are numb, these sores and ulcers may grow wider or deeper before they are noticed. High blood sugar also makes it hard for the body to fight infection. As a result, these foot ulcers may become infected. Exams and Tests Charcot foot is not always easy to

diagnose early on. It can be mistaken for sprains, bone infection, arthritis or joint swelling. Your health care provider will take your medical history and examine your foot and ankle. Blood tests and other lab work may be done to help rule out other causes.

throat Weight loss Exams and Tests If you have swollen lymph nodes and a scratch or bite from a cat, your health care provider may suspect cat-scratch disease. A physical exam may also reveal an enlarged spleen . Sometimes, an infected lymph node may form a tunnel ( fistula ) through the skin and drain (leak fluid). This disease is hard to diagnose, in part because it is rare. The Bartonella henselae immunofluorescence assay (IFA) blood test can detect the infection caused by these bacteria. The results of this test will be considered along with other information from your medical history, lab tests, or biopsy. A lymph node biopsy may also be done to look for other causes of swollen glands. Treatment Most often, cat-scratch disease is not serious. Medical treatment may not be needed. In some cases, treatment with antibiotics such as azithromycin can be helpful. Other antibiotics may be used, including: Clarithromycin Rifampin Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole Ciprofloxacin In people with HIV/AIDS and others, who have a weak immune system, cat-scratch disease can be more serious.

What are the symptoms of Cardiac arrest?,"stress -- Anything that causes a severe stress on your body can lead to cardiac arrest. This can include trauma, electrical shock, or major blood loss. Recreational drugs -- Using certain drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, also increases your risk for cardiac arrest. Medicines -- Some medicines can increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms. Symptoms Most people do not have any symptoms of cardiac arrest until it happens. Symptoms may include: Sudden loss of consciousness; a person will fall to the floor or slump down if sitting No pulse No breathing In some cases, you may notice some symptoms about an hour before cardiac arrest. These may include: A racing heart Dizziness Shortness of breath Nausea or vomiting Chest pain Exams and Tests Cardiac arrest happens so quickly, there is no time to do tests. If a person survives, most tests are done afterwards to help find out what caused the cardiac arrest. These may include: Blood tests to check for enzymes that can show if you have had a heart attack. Your health care provider may also use blood tests to check the levels of certain minerals, hormones, and chemicals in your body. Electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure

Some types are more severe than others. Many people can now expect to survive and experience a good quality of life for several years after diagnosis. Possible Complications Complications may include: Atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias Congestive heart failure Fluid buildup in the abdomen ( ascites ) Increased sensitivity to digoxin Low blood pressure and dizziness from excessive urination (due to medicine) Sick sinus syndrome Symptomatic cardiac conduction system disease (arrhythmias related to abnormal conduction of impulses through the heart muscle) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have this disorder and develop new symptoms such as: Dizziness when you change position Excessive weight (fluid) gain Excessive weight loss Fainting spells Severe breathing problems Alternative Names Amyloidosis - cardiac; Primary cardiac amyloidosis - AL type; Secondary cardiac amyloidosis - AA type; Stiff heart syndrome; Senile amyloidosis Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Amyloidosis Heart Diseases Title: Cardiac arrest Causes While some people refer to a heart attack as a cardiac arrest, they are not the same thing. A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery stops the flow of blood to the heart. The medical term for this is myocardial infarction. A heart attack can damage the heart,

your heart's electrical activity. ECG can show if your heart has been damaged from CHD or a heart attack. Echocardiogram to show if your heart has been damaged and find other types of heart problems (such as problems with the heart muscle or valves). Cardiac MRI helps your provider see detailed pictures of your heart and blood vessels. Intracardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) to see how well your heart's electrical signals are working. EPS is used to check for abnormal heartbeats or heart rhythms and to evaluate the conduction system. Cardiac catheterization lets your provider see if your arteries are narrowed or blocked. Your provider may also run other tests, depending on your health history and the results of these tests. Treatment Cardiac arrest needs emergency treatment right away to get the heart started again. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) -- This is often the first type of treatment for cardiac arrest. It can be done by anyone who has been trained in CPR. It can help keep oxygen flowing in the body until emergency care arrives. Defibrillation -- This is the most important treatment for cardiac arrest. It is performed using a medical device that gives an electrical shock to the heart.

include: Changes in mental status, especially in older adults. Chest pain that feels like pressure, squeezing, or fullness. The pain is most often in the center of the chest. It may also be felt in the jaw, shoulder, arms, back, and stomach. It can last for more than a few minutes, or come and go. Cold sweat. Lightheadedness. Nausea (more common in women). Indigestion. Vomiting. Numbness, aching, or tingling in the arm (usually the left arm, but the right arm may be affected alone, or along with the left). Shortness of breath . Weakness or fatigue, especially in older adults and in women. First Aid If you think someone is having a heart attack: Call 911 for emergency medical help. Have the person sit down, rest, and try to keep calm. Loosen any tight clothing. Ask if the person takes any chest pain medicine, such as nitroglycerin for a known heart condition, and help them take it. If the person is unconscious and unresponsive, and not breathing or does not have a pulse, call 911 or the local emergency number, then begin CPR . If you are alone and an infant or child is unconscious and unresponsive, and not breathing

complications include: A large section of heart muscle that no longer moves well or does not move at all Breaking open (rupture) of the heart muscle due to damage from the heart attack Dangerous heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , or supraventricular tachycardia Pressure on the heart due to a buildup of fluid around it (pericardial tamponade) Tear or rupture of the muscles or tendons that support the heart valves, especially the mitral valve Tear or rupture of the wall (septum) between the left and right ventricles (lower heart chambers) Very slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) or problem with the electrical system of the heart (heart block) Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to supply as much blood as the body needs. It can happen even if there hasn't been a heart attack. For example, if one of these problems listed above occurs and your heart function drops suddenly. Or if a valve becomes obstructed or if a combination of problems occurs.

way to protect yourself from cardiac arrest is to keep your heart healthy. If you have CHD or another heart condition, ask your provider how to reduce your risk for cardiac arrest. Alternative Names Sudden cardiac arrest; SCA; Cardiopulmonary arrest; Circulatory arrest; Arrhythmia - cardiac arrest; Fibrillation - cardiac arrest; Heart block - cardiac arrest Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Sudden Cardiac Arrest Title: Cardiac catheterization How the Test is Performed You will get medicine before the test to help you relax. A member of the team doing this procedure will clean a site on your arm, neck, or groin and insert a small catheter into one of your veins. This is called an intravenous (IV) line. A larger thin plastic tube called a sheath is placed into a vein or artery in your leg or arm. Then longer plastic tubes called catheters are carefully moved up into the heart using live x-rays (fluoroscopy) as a guide. Then the doctor (usually a cardiologist or heart specialist) doing the cardiac catheterization can: Collect blood samples from the heart Measure pressure and blood flow in the heart's chambers and in the large arteries around the heart Measure the oxygen levels in different parts

The shock can get the heart beating normally again. Small, portable defibrillators are often available in public areas for emergency use by people trained to use them. This treatment works best when given within a few minutes. If you survive cardiac arrest, you will be admitted to a hospital for treatment. Depending on what caused your cardiac arrest, you may need other medicines, procedures, or surgery. You may have a small device, called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placed under your skin near your chest. An ICD monitors your heartbeat and gives your heart an electric shock if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people do not survive cardiac arrest. If you have had a cardiac arrest, you are at high risk of having another. You will need to work closely with your doctors to reduce your risk. Possible Complications Cardiac arrest can cause some lasting health problems including: Brain injury Heart problems Lung conditions Infection You may need ongoing care and treatment to manage some of these complications.

scan or heart MRI Treatment IMMEDIATE TREATMENT You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. You will receive oxygen. An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. Dangerous abnormal heartbeats ( arrhythmias ) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed right after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again.

The most important treatment for cardiac arrest is defibrillation, which is performed using a medical device that gives an electrical shock to the heart to get it beating normally again. Small, portable defibrillators are often available in public areas for emergency use by people trained to use them. This treatment works best when given within a few minutes. If you survive cardiac arrest, you will be admitted to a hospital for further treatment, which may include medicines, procedures, or surgery, and possibly an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to monitor and correct abnormal heart rhythms.",0.930854320526123,0.6341463414634145,0.960713267326355,0.7283950617283951,0.8507996108473801
How can Cardiac arrest be prevented?,"way to protect yourself from cardiac arrest is to keep your heart healthy. If you have CHD or another heart condition, ask your provider how to reduce your risk for cardiac arrest. Alternative Names Sudden cardiac arrest; SCA; Cardiopulmonary arrest; Circulatory arrest; Arrhythmia - cardiac arrest; Fibrillation - cardiac arrest; Heart block - cardiac arrest Related MedlinePlus Health Topics Sudden Cardiac Arrest Title: Cardiac catheterization How the Test is Performed You will get medicine before the test to help you relax. A member of the team doing this procedure will clean a site on your arm, neck, or groin and insert a small catheter into one of your veins. This is called an intravenous (IV) line. A larger thin plastic tube called a sheath is placed into a vein or artery in your leg or arm. Then longer plastic tubes called catheters are carefully moved up into the heart using live x-rays (fluoroscopy) as a guide. Then the doctor (usually a cardiologist or heart specialist) doing the cardiac catheterization can: Collect blood samples from the heart Measure pressure and blood flow in the heart's chambers and in the large arteries around the heart Measure the oxygen levels in different parts

The shock can get the heart beating normally again. Small, portable defibrillators are often available in public areas for emergency use by people trained to use them. This treatment works best when given within a few minutes. If you survive cardiac arrest, you will be admitted to a hospital for treatment. Depending on what caused your cardiac arrest, you may need other medicines, procedures, or surgery. You may have a small device, called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placed under your skin near your chest. An ICD monitors your heartbeat and gives your heart an electric shock if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people do not survive cardiac arrest. If you have had a cardiac arrest, you are at high risk of having another. You will need to work closely with your doctors to reduce your risk. Possible Complications Cardiac arrest can cause some lasting health problems including: Brain injury Heart problems Lung conditions Infection You may need ongoing care and treatment to manage some of these complications. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider or 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have: Chest pain Shortness of breath Prevention The best

but it does not necessarily cause death. However, a heart attack can sometimes trigger a cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is caused by a problem with the heart's electrical system, such as: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) -- When VF occurs, the lower chambers in the heart quiver instead of beating regularly. The heart cannot pump blood, which results in cardiac arrest. This can happen without any cause or as a result of another condition. Heart block -- This occurs when the electrical signal is slowed or stopped as it moves through the heart. Problems that may lead to cardiac arrest include: Coronary heart disease (CHD) -- CHD can clog the arteries in your heart, so the blood cannot flow smoothly. Over time, this can put a strain on your heart's muscle and electrical system. Heart attack -- A prior heart attack can create scar tissue that can lead to VF and cardiac arrest. Heart problems, such as congenital heart disease, heart valve problems, heart rhythm problems, and an enlarged heart can also lead to cardiac arrest. Abnormal levels of potassium or magnesium -- These minerals help your heart's electrical system work. Abnormally high or low levels can cause cardiac arrest. Severe physical

your heart's electrical activity. ECG can show if your heart has been damaged from CHD or a heart attack. Echocardiogram to show if your heart has been damaged and find other types of heart problems (such as problems with the heart muscle or valves). Cardiac MRI helps your provider see detailed pictures of your heart and blood vessels. Intracardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) to see how well your heart's electrical signals are working. EPS is used to check for abnormal heartbeats or heart rhythms and to evaluate the conduction system. Cardiac catheterization lets your provider see if your arteries are narrowed or blocked. Your provider may also run other tests, depending on your health history and the results of these tests. Treatment Cardiac arrest needs emergency treatment right away to get the heart started again. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) -- This is often the first type of treatment for cardiac arrest. It can be done by anyone who has been trained in CPR. It can help keep oxygen flowing in the body until emergency care arrives. Defibrillation -- This is the most important treatment for cardiac arrest. It is performed using a medical device that gives an electrical shock to the heart.

shock is delivered to your heart. This shock briefly stops all electrical activity of the heart. Then it allows the normal heart rhythm to return. Sometimes more than one shock, or a shock with higher energy is needed. An external defibrillator is used to treat abnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmia ) that cause collapse and cardiac arrest. Examples are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. These same devices may also be used to treat less dangerous abnormal rhythms, problems such as atrial fibrillation. Some people may need to start blood thinners beforehand to prevent small blood clots. You will be given medicine to help you relax before the procedure. After the procedure, you may be given medicines to prevent blood clots or to help prevent the arrhythmia from coming back. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that is placed inside your body. It is most often used in people who are at risk for sudden death because their heart function is so poor, or they have had dangerous heart rhythms before. The ICD is implanted underneath the skin of your upper chest or abdomen. Wires are attached that go into or near the heart. If the device detects a dangerous","Cardiac arrest can be prevented by maintaining a healthy heart, which includes:

1. Regular exercise: Regular physical activity helps to keep your heart strong and improves circulation.

2. Balanced diet: Eating a diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, and added sugars can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including cardiac arrest.

3. Maintain a healthy weight: Excess weight can put a strain on your heart, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

4. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol: Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can damage the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of cardiac arrest.","The best way to protect yourself from cardiac arrest is to keep your heart healthy. If you have coronary heart disease (CHD) or another heart condition, it's important to ask your healthcare provider how to reduce your risk. CHD can clog the arteries in your heart, making it harder for blood to flow smoothly. This can strain your heart's muscle and electrical system over time.

Here are some ways to maintain a healthy heart:

- Eat a balanced diet.
- Stay active and exercise regularly.
- Maintain a healthy weight.
- Avoid smoking.
- Manage stress.

Cataract surgery is usually done if you cannot see well enough because of cataracts. Cataracts usually do not permanently damage your eye, so you and your eye doctor can decide when surgery is right for you. Risks In rare cases, the entire lens cannot be removed. If this happens, a procedure to remove all of the lens fragments will be done at a later time. Afterward, vision can still be improved. Very rare complications can include infection and bleeding. This can lead to permanent vision problems. Before the Procedure Before surgery, you will have a complete eye exam and eye tests by the ophthalmologist. Your doctor will use ultrasound or a laser scanning device to measure your eye. These tests help determine the best IOL for you.

Symptoms Symptoms of the condition include: Eyes that turn in or out Eyes that do not appear to work together Inability to judge depth correctly Poor vision in one eye Exams and Tests In most cases, amblyopia can be detected with a complete eye exam. Special tests are not often needed. Treatment The first step will be to correct any eye condition that is causing poor vision in the amblyopic eye (such as cataracts). Children with a refractive error (nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism) will need glasses. Next, a patch is placed on the normal eye. This forces the brain to recognize the image from the eye with amblyopia. Sometimes, drops are used to blur the vision of the normal eye instead of putting a patch on it. Newer treatment techniques use digital computer technology, to show a slightly different image to each eye. Over time, the vision between the eyes becomes equalized. Children whose vision will not fully recover, and those with only one good eye due to any disorder should wear glasses. These glasses should be shatter- and scratch-resistant.

Topics Choking First Aid Title: Choking - infant under 1 year Causes Choking in infants is usually caused by breathing in a small object that the baby has placed in their mouth, such as a button, coin, balloon, toy part, or watch battery. Choking may result from a complete or partial blockage of the airway. A complete blockage is a medical emergency. A partial blockage can quickly become life threatening if the baby cannot get enough air. When a person does not get enough air, permanent brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a life. Symptoms The danger signs of choking are: Bluish skin color (cyanosis) Difficulty breathing -- ribs and chest pull inward Loss of consciousness (unresponsiveness) if blockage is not cleared Inability to cry or make much sound Weak, ineffective coughing Soft or high-pitched sounds while inhaling First Aid DO NOT perform these steps if the infant is coughing hard or has a strong cry. Strong coughs and cries can help push the object out of the airway. If your child is not coughing forcefully or does not have a strong cry, follow these steps: Lay the infant

choking first aid if the infant is coughing forcefully, has a strong cry, or is breathing enough. However, be ready to act if the symptoms get worse. DO NOT try to grasp and pull out the object if the infant is alert (conscious). DO NOT do back blows and chest thrusts if the infant stops breathing for other reasons, such as asthma, infection, swelling, or a blow to the head. DO give the infant CPR in these cases. When to Contact a Medical Professional If an infant is choking: Tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number while you begin first aid. If you are alone, shout for help and begin first aid. Always call your doctor after a child has been choking, even if you successfully remove the object from the airway and the infant seems fine. Prevention To prevent choking in an infant: Do not give children under 3 years old balloons or toys with small parts that can break off. Keep infants away from buttons, popcorn, coins, grapes, nuts, and other small items. Watch infants and toddlers while they are eating. Do not allow a child to crawl around while eating.

Topics Choking First Aid Title: Choking - infant under 1 year Causes Choking in infants is usually caused by breathing in a small object that the baby has placed in their mouth, such as a button, coin, balloon, toy part, or watch battery. Choking may result from a complete or partial blockage of the airway. A complete blockage is a medical emergency. A partial blockage can quickly become life threatening if the baby cannot get enough air. When a person does not get enough air, permanent brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a life. Symptoms The danger signs of choking are: Bluish skin color (cyanosis) Difficulty breathing -- ribs and chest pull inward Loss of consciousness (unresponsiveness) if blockage is not cleared Inability to cry or make much sound Weak, ineffective coughing Soft or high-pitched sounds while inhaling First Aid DO NOT perform these steps if the infant is coughing hard or has a strong cry. Strong coughs and cries can help push the object out of the airway. If your child is not coughing forcefully or does not have a strong cry, follow these steps: Lay the infant

emergency number or tell someone else to do so. Begin CPR . Chest compressions may help dislodge the object. Abdominal thrusts are for a conscious choking victim. Chest compressions are for an unconscious choking victim . If you see something blocking the airway and it is loose, try to remove it. If the object is lodged in the person's throat, DO NOT try to grasp it. This can push the object farther into the airway. FOR PREGNANT OR OBESE PEOPLE Wrap your arms around the person's CHEST. Place your fist on the MIDDLE of the breastbone between the nipples. � Make firm, backward thrusts. After removing the object that caused the choking, keep the person still and get medical help. Anyone who is choking should have a medical examination. Complications can occur not only from the choking, but also from the first aid measures that were taken. DO NOT DO NOT interfere if the person is coughing forcefully, is able to speak, or is able to breathe in and out adequately. But, be ready to act right away if the person's symptoms get worse. DO NOT force open the person's mouth to try to grasp and pull out the object

DI is a different disease than diabetes , though both share common symptoms of excessive urination and thirst. Central diabetes insipidus is a form of DI that occurs when the body has a lower than normal amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin . ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus . ADH is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland at the base of the brain. ADH controls the amount of water excreted in urine. Without ADH, the kidneys do not work properly to keep enough water in the body. The result is a rapid loss of water from the body in the form of dilute urine. This results in the need to drink large amounts of water due to extreme thirst and to

Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease. Symptoms A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including: Blurry vision Excess thirst Fatigue Frequent urination Hunger Weight loss Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period, usually weeks to months. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed. After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include: Eye problems , including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, cataracts, and blindness Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot Damage to nerves in the body , causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems","The symptoms of Central diabetes insipidus include increased urine production, excessive thirst, confusion, and changes in alertness due to dehydration and a higher than normal sodium level in the body, if the person is unable to drink.

Choking may result from a complete or partial blockage of the airway. A complete blockage is a medical emergency. A partial blockage can quickly become life threatening if the baby cannot get enough air. When a person does not get enough air, permanent brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a life. Symptoms The danger signs of choking are: Bluish skin color (cyanosis) Difficulty breathing -- ribs and chest pull inward Loss of consciousness (unresponsiveness) if blockage is not cleared Inability to cry or make much sound Weak, ineffective coughing Soft or high-pitched sounds while inhaling First Aid DO NOT perform these steps if the infant is coughing hard or has a strong cry. Strong coughs and cries can help push the object out of the airway. If your child is not coughing forcefully or does not have a strong cry, follow these steps: Lay the infant

What are the symptoms of Cervical dysplasia?,"the presence of HPV. Cervical dysplasia that is seen on a Pap test is called squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). On the Pap test report, any abnormal changes will be described as: Low-grade (LSIL) High-grade (HSIL) Possibly cancerous (malignant) Atypical glandular cells (AGC) Atypical squamous cells (ASC) You will need more tests if a Pap test shows abnormal cells or cervical dysplasia. If the changes were mild, follow-up Pap tests may be all that is needed. The provider may perform a biopsy to confirm the condition. This may be done with the use of colposcopy . Any areas of concern will be biopsied. The biopsies are very small and most women feel only a small cramp. Dysplasia that is seen on a biopsy of the cervix is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). It is grouped into 3 categories: CIN I -- mild dysplasia CIN II -- moderate to marked dysplasia CIN III -- severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ Some strains of HPV are known to cause cervical cancer. An HPV DNA test can identify the high-risk types of HPV linked to this cancer. This test may be done: As a screening test for women age 30 or more For women

cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar (gland cells). Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia . This condition can be detected by a Pap test and is nearly 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap tests, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap test results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through skin-to-skin contact and also by sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical as well as other cancers. Other strains can cause genital warts . Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman's sexual behavior can increase her risk for developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: Having sex at an early age Having multiple sexual partners Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer","Most of the time, cervical dysplasia does not have symptoms. However, some symptoms that may occur include abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause, vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling, periods that become heavier and last longer than usual. These symptoms can be a sign of more advanced cervical cancer, which may also cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, back pain, bone pain or fractures, fatigue, leaking of urine or feces from the vagina, leg pain, loss of appetite, pelvic pain, single swollen leg,","Most of the time, cervical dysplasia has no symptoms.",0.7318680882453918,0.1308411214953271,0.615217924118042,0.0945945945945946,0.5165649489821674
What is the treatment for Cervical dysplasia?,"of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result Treatment Treatment depends on the degree of dysplasia. Mild dysplasia (LSIL or CIN I) may go away without treatment. Changes due to HPV infection may also go away without treatment or dysplasia. You may only need careful follow-up by your provider with repeat Pap tests every 6 to 12 months. If the changes do not go away or get worse, treatment is needed. Treatment for moderate-to-severe dysplasia or mild dysplasia that does not go away may include: Cryosurgery to freeze abnormal cells Laser therapy, which uses light to burn away abnormal tissue LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), which uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue Surgery to remove the abnormal tissue (cone biopsy) Hysterectomy (in rare cases) If you have had dysplasia, you will need to have repeat exams every 12 months or as suggested by your provider. Make sure to get the HPV vaccine when it is offered to you. This vaccine prevents many cervical cancers.

cervical cancer depends on: The stage of the cancer The size and shape of the tumor The woman's age and general health Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why Pap tests done at the recommended times are so important to prevent cervical cancer, or catch it at an early stage. There are surgical ways to cure cervical cancer without removing the uterus or seriously damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for cervical precancer, and on occasion, very small early cervical cancer include: LEEP -- uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue. Cryotherapy -- freezes abnormal cells. Laser therapy -- uses light to burn abnormal tissue. Hysterectomy may be done for women with precancer who have undergone multiple LEEP procedures, or who are not interested in further childbearing. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. This is more often performed on younger, healthier women with small tumors. Radiation therapy,

On the Pap test report, any abnormal changes will be described as: Low-grade (LSIL) High-grade (HSIL) Possibly cancerous (malignant) Atypical glandular cells (AGC) Atypical squamous cells (ASC) You will need more tests if a Pap test shows abnormal cells or cervical dysplasia. If the changes were mild, follow-up Pap tests may be all that is needed. The provider may perform a biopsy to confirm the condition. This may be done with the use of colposcopy . Any areas of concern will be biopsied. The biopsies are very small and most women feel only a small cramp. Dysplasia that is seen on a biopsy of the cervix is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). It is grouped into 3 categories: CIN I -- mild dysplasia CIN II -- moderate to marked dysplasia CIN III -- severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ Some strains of HPV are known to cause cervical cancer. An HPV DNA test can identify the high-risk types of HPV linked to this cancer. This test may be done: As a screening test for women age 30 or more For women

What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?,"disease include: Living in a hut where reduviid bugs live in the walls Living in Central or South America Poverty Receiving a blood transfusion or an organ donation from a person who carries the parasite, but does not have active Chagas disease Symptoms Chagas disease has two phases: acute and chronic . The acute phase may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms, including: Fever General ill feeling Swelling of an eye if the bite is near the eye Swollen red area at site of the insect bite After the acute phase, the disease goes into remission. No other symptoms may appear for many years. When symptoms finally develop, they may include: Constipation Digestive problems Heart failure Pain in the abdomen Pounding or racing heart Swallowing difficulties Exams and Tests Physical examination can confirm the symptoms. Signs of Chagas disease may include: Disease of the heart muscle Enlarged liver and spleen Enlarged lymph nodes Irregular heartbeat Rapid heartbeat Tests include: Blood culture to look for signs of infection Chest x-ray Echocardiogram (uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart) Electrocardiogram ( ECG , tests electrical activity in the heart) Enzyme-linked immunoassay ( ELISA ) to look for signs of

infection Blood smear to look for signs of infection Treatment The acute phase of reactivated Chagas disease should be treated. Infants born with the infection should also be treated. Treating the chronic phase is recommended for children and most adults. Adults with chronic phase Chagas disease should talk to their health care provider to decide whether treatment is needed. Two drugs are used to treat this infection: benznidazole and nifurtimox. Both drugs often have side effects. The side effects may be worse in older people. They may include: Headaches and dizziness Loss of appetite and weight loss Nerve damage Problems sleeping Skin rashes Outlook (Prognosis) About one third of infected people who are not treated will develop chronic or symptomatic Chagas disease. It may take more than 20 years from the time of the original infection to develop heart or digestive problems. Abnormal heart rhythms may cause sudden death. Once heart failure develops, death usually occurs within several years. Possible Complications Chagas disease can cause these complications: Enlarged colon Enlarged esophagus with swallowing difficulty Heart disease Heart failure Malnutrition When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if you think you may have Chagas disease.

These glands are located in the eyelid directly behind the eyelashes. They produce a thin, oily fluid that lubricates the eye. Symptoms A chalazion often develops following an internal hordeolum (also called a stye). The eyelid most often becomes tender, red, swollen and warm. Sometimes, the blocked gland causing the stye will not drain even though the redness and swelling go away. The gland will form a firm nodule in the eyelid that is not tender. This is called a chalazion. Exams and Tests An exam of the eyelid confirms the diagnosis. Rarely, skin cancer of the eyelid may look like a chalazion. If this is suspected, you may

Wearing 100% cotton fabric against your skin may help. Reduce friction against your skin by wearing the right kind of clothing for the activity you are doing (for example, athletic tights for running or cycling shorts for biking). Avoid activities that cause chafing unless they are part of your typical lifestyle, exercise, or sports routine. Wear clean and dry clothing. Dried sweat, chemicals, dirt, and other debris may cause irritation. Use petroleum jelly or baby powder on chafed areas until the skin heals. You can also use these before activities to prevent chafing in easily irritated areas, for example, on your inner thighs or upper arms before running.

Risk factors for Chagas","Chagas disease can be prevented in several ways:

1. Living in houses that are less likely to have high insect populations, such as houses with cement floors and walls, and screens on windows and doors.
2. Insect control with insecticides.
3. In Central and South America, blood banks screen donors for exposure to the parasite. The blood is discarded if the donor has the parasite. Most blood banks in the United States began screening for Chagas disease in 2007.
4. In areas where the disease is common, taking precautions when handling or eating food that may be contaminated by the parasite, such as avoiding eating raw foods and properly","To prevent Chagas disease, consider the following steps:

1. **Insect control**: Use insecticides and improve housing conditions to reduce the presence of reduviid bugs (kissing bugs), which spread the disease.

2. **Blood screening**: Ensure blood donors are screened for exposure to the parasite. This is already done in most blood banks in the United States and many other countries.

3. **Avoidance**: Be aware of the risk factors, such as living in areas where the bugs are common, like Central or South America, and take precautions to avoid insect bites.",0.89227294921875,0.31313131313131315,0.9292761087417603,0.3670886075949367,0.729631406249422

cervical cancer depends on: The stage of the cancer The size and shape of the tumor The woman's age and general health Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why Pap tests done at the recommended times are so important to prevent cervical cancer, or catch it at an early stage. There are surgical ways to cure cervical cancer without removing the uterus or seriously damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for cervical precancer, and on occasion, very small early cervical cancer include: LEEP -- uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue. Cryotherapy -- freezes abnormal cells. Laser therapy -- uses light to burn abnormal tissue. Hysterectomy may be done for women with precancer who have undergone multiple LEEP procedures, or who are not interested in further childbearing. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. This is more often performed on younger, healthier women with small tumors. Radiation therapy,

of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result Treatment Treatment depends on the degree of dysplasia. Mild dysplasia (LSIL or CIN I) may go away without treatment. Changes due to HPV infection may also go away without treatment or dysplasia. You may only need careful follow-up by your provider with repeat Pap tests every 6 to 12 months. If the changes do not go away or get worse, treatment is needed. Treatment for moderate-to-severe dysplasia or mild dysplasia that does not go away may include: Cryosurgery to freeze abnormal cells Laser therapy, which uses light to burn away abnormal tissue LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), which uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue Surgery to remove the abnormal tissue (cone biopsy) Hysterectomy (in rare cases) If you have had dysplasia, you will need to have repeat exams every 12 months or as suggested by your provider. Make sure to get the HPV vaccine when it is offered to you. This vaccine prevents many cervical cancers. Outlook (Prognosis) Early diagnosis and prompt treatment cures most cases of cervical dysplasia. However, the condition may return.

Possible Complications Complications can include: Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you: Have not had regular Pap tests Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Prevention Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: Get the HPV vaccine . The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. Practice safer sex . Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. Get Pap tests as often as your provider recommends. Pap tests can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older, or for some screening protocols, starting at age 25. If you smoke, quit

of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result Treatment Treatment depends on the degree of dysplasia. Mild dysplasia (LSIL or CIN I) may go away without treatment. Changes due to HPV infection may also go away without treatment or dysplasia. You may only need careful follow-up by your provider with repeat Pap tests every 6 to 12 months. If the changes do not go away or get worse, treatment is needed. Treatment for moderate-to-severe dysplasia or mild dysplasia that does not go away may include: Cryosurgery to freeze abnormal cells Laser therapy, which uses light to burn away abnormal tissue LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), which uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue Surgery to remove the abnormal tissue (cone biopsy) Hysterectomy (in rare cases) If you have had dysplasia, you will need to have repeat exams every 12 months or as suggested by your provider. Make sure to get the HPV vaccine when it is offered to you. This vaccine prevents many cervical cancers. Outlook (Prognosis) Early diagnosis and prompt treatment cures most cases of cervical dysplasia. However, the condition may return. Without treatment, severe cervical dysplasia may change into cervical cancer. When to Contact a Medical

cervical cancer depends on: The stage of the cancer The size and shape of the tumor The woman's age and general health Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why Pap tests done at the recommended times are so important to prevent cervical cancer, or catch it at an early stage. There are surgical ways to cure cervical cancer without removing the uterus or seriously damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for cervical precancer, and on occasion, very small early cervical cancer include: LEEP -- uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue. Cryotherapy -- freezes abnormal cells. Laser therapy -- uses light to burn abnormal tissue. Hysterectomy may be done for women with precancer who have undergone multiple LEEP procedures, or who are not interested in further childbearing. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. This is more often performed on younger, healthier women with small tumors. Radiation therapy,","Cervical polyps cannot be prevented in the same way as cervical cancer, as the exact cause of cervical polyps is not known. However, maintaining good gynecological health by attending regular exams, treating infections promptly, and getting the HPV vaccine if recommended by a healthcare provider, can help reduce the risk of developing cervical polyps or cervical cancer. It's also important to practice safer sex, limit the number of sexual partners, and avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors.

What are the symptoms of Chediak-Higashi syndrome?,"Intellectual disability Muscle weakness Nerve problems in the limbs ( peripheral neuropathy ) Nosebleeds or easy bruising Numbness Tremor Seizures Sensitivity to bright light (photophobia) Unsteady walking ( ataxia ) Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show signs of a swollen spleen or liver or jaundice. Tests that may be done include: Complete blood count, including white blood cell count Blood platelet count Blood culture and smear Brain MRI or CT EEG EMG Nerve conduction tests Treatment There is no specific treatment for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. High doses of vitamin C may help some children whose condition is in the stable phase. Hematopoietic stem cells appear to have been successful in several patients. Antibiotics are used to treat and, sometimes, prevent infections. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, and chemotherapy drugs are often used in the accelerated phase of the disease. Blood and platelet transfusions are given as needed. Surgery may be needed to drain abscesses in some cases. Support Groups More information and support for people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome and their families can be found at: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/chediak-higashi-syndrome/ Outlook (Prognosis) Death often occurs in the first 10

It is an autosomal recessive disease. This means that both parents are carriers of a non-working copy of the gene. Each parent must pass their non-working gene to the child for them to show symptoms of the disease. Defects have been found in the LYST (also called CHS1 ) gene. The primary defect in this disease is found in certain substances normally present in skin cells and certain white blood cells. Symptoms Children with this condition may have: Silver hair, light-colored eyes (albinism) Increased infections in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes Jerky eye movements ( nystagmus ) Infection of affected children with certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ), can cause a life-threatening illness resembling the blood cancer lymphoma called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Other symptoms may include: Decreased vision

years of life, from long-term (chronic) infections or accelerated disease that results in the lymphoma-like illness (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). However, some affected children have survived longer. Possible Complications Complications may include: Frequent infections involving certain types of bacteria Lymphoma-like cancer triggered by viral infections such as EBV Early death When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have a family history of this disorder and you are planning to have children. Talk to your provider if your child shows symptoms of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Prevention Genetic counseling is recommended before becoming pregnant if you have a family history of Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
