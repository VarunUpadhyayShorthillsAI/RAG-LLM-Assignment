Symptoms
In general, wax is not poisonous. If a child eats a small amount of crayon, the wax will pass through the child's system without causing a problem. However, eating large amounts of wax or crayons can lead to intestinal obstruction . People attempting to smuggle illegal drugs across international borders sometimes swallow packets of illegal substances that are layered in wax. If the packaging ruptures the drug is released, usually causing severe poisoning. The wax can then cause intestinal obstruction as well.
