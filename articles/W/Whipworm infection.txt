Title: Whipworm infection

Causes
Whipworm infection is caused by the roundworm Trichuris trichiura . It is a common infection that mainly affects children. Children may become infected if they swallow soil contaminated with whipworm eggs. When the eggs hatch inside the body, the whipworm sticks inside the wall of the large intestine. Whipworm is found throughout the world, especially in countries with warm, humid climates. Some outbreaks have been traced to contaminated vegetables (caused by soil contamination).

Symptoms
Most people who have whipworm infections don't have symptoms. Symptoms mainly occur in children, and range from mild to severe. A severe infection may cause: Bloody diarrhea Iron-deficiency anemia Fecal incontinence (during sleep) Rectal prolapse (the rectum comes out of the anus)

Exams and Tests
A stool ova and parasites exam reveals the presence of whipworm eggs.

Treatment
The drug albendazole is commonly prescribed when the infection causes symptoms. A different anti-worm medicine may also be prescribed.

Outlook (Prognosis)
Full recovery is expected with treatment.

When to Contact a Medical Professional
Seek medical attention if you or your child develop bloody diarrhea. In addition to whipworm, many other infections and illnesses can cause similar symptoms.

Prevention
Improved facilities for feces disposal have decreased the incidence of whipworm. Always wash your hands before handling food. Teach your children to wash their hands, too. Thoroughly washing food may also help prevent this condition.
