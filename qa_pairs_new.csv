./articles/C/Chickenpox.txt,What are the symptoms of Chickenpox?,"Before the rash appears, most children with chickenpox have:
- Fever
- Headache
- Stomach ache

The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop:
- 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin
- Blisters first appear on the face, middle of the body, or scalp, then spread to other areas
- Blisters become cloudy after a day or two, then scab over
- New blisters form in groups as old ones scab
- Blisters may appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids
- Children with skin problems like eczema may get thousands of blisters"
./articles/C/Chickenpox.txt,What is the treatment for Chickenpox?,"The treatment for chickenpox involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are some things to try:

- **Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas**: Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching.
- **Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes**: Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area.
- **Take lukewarm baths**: Use little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath.
- **Apply a soothing moisturizer**: After bathing, use a moisturizer to soften and cool the skin.
- **Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity**.
- **Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines**: Such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness.
- **Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream**: On itchy areas.

Antiviral medicines may be prescribed, but they are not very often given to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. These medicines work best if started within the first 24 hours of the rash. They may be more important for people with certain conditions or who are at risk for more severe symptoms.

**Avoid aspirin or ibuprofen**: Do not give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reye syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used to manage fever or discomfort.

A person with chickenpox should not return to school, work, or be around others until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out."
./articles/C/Chickenpox.txt,How can Chickenpox be prevented?,"Chickenpox can be prevented through vaccination. A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule. The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild. If you think your child might be at high risk for complications and might have been exposed, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider. Additionally, giving the vaccine early after exposure may still reduce the severity of the disease."

Some cancers may not have any symptoms, and in certain cancers, like pancreatic cancer, symptoms often do not start until the disease has reached an advanced stage."
./articles/C/Cancer.txt,What is the treatment for Cancer?,"The treatment for cancer varies based on the type of cancer and its stage. The stage refers to how much the cancer has grown and whether it has spread from its original location. Here are some common treatments:

1. **Surgery**: If the cancer is in one location and hasn't spread, surgery may be used to remove the tumor. This is often the case with skin cancers, as well as cancers of the lung, breast, and colon. If the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes, these may also be removed.

2. **Radiation Therapy**: This uses powerful x-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells. It may be used to treat the cancer, relieve symptoms, or help with pain.

3. **Chemotherapy**: This uses medicines to kill cancer cells and stop new cells from growing. It's often used when the cancer has spread or to shrink the tumor before or after surgery.

4. **Immunotherapy**: This helps your immune system fight cancer. It can be given alone or with chemotherapy.

5. **Targeted Therapy**: This uses medicines to target specific molecules in or on cancer cells to stop them from growing and spreading.

Some cancers require a combination of these treatments. Also, other types of treatment may be used, such as hormone therapy or stem cell transplants. Always remember that treatments are recommended based on what is best for each individual patient."
./articles/C/Cancer.txt,How can Cancer be prevented?,"You can reduce the risk of getting cancer by:

- Eating healthy foods

  - Due to numbness, these sores and ulcers may grow wider or deeper before they are noticed.
  - Possible infection of foot ulcers."
./articles/C/Charcot foot.txt,What is the treatment for Charcot foot?,"The goal of treatment for Charcot foot is to stop bone loss, allow bones to heal, and prevent bones from moving out of place (deformity). Here are the key aspects of treatment:

1. **Immobilization**: Your provider will have you wear a total contact cast to limit movement of your foot and ankle. You will likely need to keep your weight off your foot entirely, using crutches, a knee-walker device, or a wheelchair. New casts will be placed on your foot as the swelling goes down. Healing can take a couple of months or more.

2. **Protective footwear**: Once your foot has healed, your provider may suggest footwear to help support your foot and prevent re-injury. These may include splints, braces, orthotic insoles, or a Charcot restraint orthotic walker (a special boot that provides even pressure to the whole foot).

3. **Activity changes**: You will always be at risk for Charcot foot coming back or developing in your other foot. So your provider may recommend activity changes, such as limiting your standing or walking, to protect your feet. You may need to use a wheelchair to limit activity on your feet.

4. **Surgery**: You may need surgery if you have foot ulcers that keep coming back or severe foot or ankle deformity. Surgery can help stabilize your foot and ankle joints and remove bony areas to prevent foot ulcers.

5. **Ongoing monitoring**: You will need to see your provider for checkups and take steps to protect your feet for the rest of your life."

./articles/D/Delayed ejaculation.txt,What is the treatment for Delayed ejaculation?,"If you have never ejaculated through any form of stimulation, see your health care provider to determine if the problem has a physical cause. Your provider may refer you to a urologist for additional evaluation and advice. See a therapist who specializes in ejaculation problems if you are unable to ejaculate in an acceptable amount of time. Sex therapy most often includes both partners. In most cases, the therapist will teach you about the sexual response. You also will learn how to communicate and guide your partner to provide the right stimulation. Therapy often involves a series of ""homework"" assignments. In the privacy of your home, you and your partner engage in sexual activities that reduce performance pressure and focus on pleasure. Typically, you will not have sexual intercourse for a certain period of time. In this time, you will gradually learn to enjoy ejaculation through other types of stimulation. In cases where there is a problem with the relationship or a lack of sexual desire, you may need therapy to improve your relationship and emotional intimacy. Sometimes, hypnosis may be a helpful addition to therapy."

./articles/F/Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency.txt,What are the symptoms of Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency?,"The symptoms of Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency may include:

- Abdominal pain (which may appear as colic in infants)
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea, vomiting
- Pain in the muscles and bones
- Enlarged liver and spleen
- Failure to thrive in infants
- Fatty deposits in the skin (called xanthomas)

These symptoms are due to the body's inability to break down fat from digested food because of a missing enzyme called lipoprotein lipase."
./articles/F/Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency.txt,What is the treatment for Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency?,"The treatment for Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency involves following a very low-fat diet. This is crucial because people with this condition lack an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which helps break down fat from digested food. Without this enzyme, fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood. By adhering to a very low-fat diet, individuals can manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of complications such as pancreatitis and recurrent episodes of abdominal pain. Additionally, medications like nicotinic acid, gemfibrozil, and fenofibrate may be prescribed to lower triglyceride levels if diet changes alone are not sufficient."
./articles/F/Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency.txt,How can Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency be prevented?,"Based on the provided context, there is no known prevention for familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency as it is a rare, inherited disorder.

- Easily moveable under the skin
- Firm
- Painless
- Rubbery

They have smooth, well-defined borders and may grow in size, especially during pregnancy. These lumps often get smaller after menopause, unless a woman is taking hormone therapy."
./articles/F/Fibroadenoma of the breast.txt,What is the treatment for Fibroadenoma of the breast?,"The treatment for Fibroadenoma of the breast depends on the situation. If a needle biopsy confirms that the lump is a fibroadenoma, it may be left in place or removed. Reasons to have it removed include:

- If the results of the needle biopsy are not definitive
- If the lump is causing pain or other symptoms
- If there is concern about cancer
- If the lump gets larger over time

If the lump is not removed, your healthcare provider will monitor it to see if it changes or grows using methods like mammograms, physical examinations, or ultrasounds.

Sometimes, the lump can be destroyed without removing it through procedures like:

- **Cryoablation**: Destroys the lump by freezing it using a probe guided by ultrasound.
- **Radiofrequency ablation**: Destroys the lump using high-frequency energy, which heats and destroys the lump without affecting nearby tissues.

These treatments are typically discussed with your healthcare provider to decide the best course of action."

Most femoral hernias cause no symptoms, but you may have some groin discomfort that worsens when you stand, lift heavy objects, or strain. Sometimes, the first symptoms can be more severe and may include:

- Sudden groin or thigh pain
- Abdominal pain
- Tingling feeling or numbness in the groin area
- Nausea
- Vomiting

These severe symptoms may mean that the intestine within the hernia is blocked, which is an emergency."
./articles/F/Femoral hernia.txt,What is the treatment for Femoral hernia?,"The treatment for a femoral hernia depends on the symptoms present. Here are some key points:

1. **Emergency Situations**: If you feel sudden pain in your groin or thigh, it might indicate that a piece of intestine is stuck in the hernia (incarcerated hernia). This requires immediate medical attention in an emergency room, and you may need emergency surgery.

2. **Ongoing Discomfort**: If you have ongoing discomfort from a femoral hernia, you should talk to your healthcare provider about treatment options. Hernias do not go away on their own and often get larger over time.

3. **Surgery**: Your surgeon may recommend femoral hernia repair surgery to avoid a possible medical emergency. The surgery aims to fix the weak area to prevent the intestine from getting stuck.

4. **Non-Surgical Management**: If surgery is not done right away, you can take steps to manage the hernia, such as:
   - Increasing your fiber intake and drinking fluids to avoid constipation.
   - Losing weight if you are overweight.
   - Seeing your provider if you have trouble urinating (for men).
   - Using proper lifting techniques.

5. **Prognosis**: The chances of a femoral hernia coming back after surgery are low. However, if the intestine or other tissue becomes stuck, a portion of the intestine may need to be removed.

If you have any concerns or symptoms related to a femoral hernia, it's important to contact your healthcare provider for guidance."
./articles/F/Femoral hernia.txt,How can Femoral hernia be prevented?,"It is difficult to prevent a femoral hernia. However, making changes in your lifestyle can help.

These symptoms occur on the nail surface and can affect both fingernails and toenails, though toenails are more commonly affected."
./articles/F/Fungal nail infection.txt,What is the treatment for Fungal nail infection?,"The treatment for a fungal nail infection typically involves prescription antifungal medicines taken by mouth. These medicines need to be taken for about 2 to 3 months for toenails and a shorter time for fingernails. During this treatment, your healthcare provider will do lab tests to check for any liver damage.

In some cases, laser treatments might be used, but they are less effective than medicines. If the infection is severe, the nail might need to be removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion, and it takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow.

Over-the-counter creams and ointments usually do not help treat this condition effectively."
./articles/F/Fungal nail infection.txt,How can Fungal nail infection be prevented?,"To prevent fungal nail infections, consider the following steps:

1. **Keep your feet clean and dry**: Fungi thrive in moist environments, so it's important to keep your feet clean and dry. Wear shoes that allow air to reach your feet and avoid wearing the same shoes every day to let them air out.

2. **Trim your toenails properly**: When trimming your toenails, briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails, then cut them straight across to prevent ingrown toenails.

3. **Wear proper-fitting shoes**: Shoes that fit well can help prevent nail damage that could lead to infections. Make sure you have enough room for your toes.

4. **Avoid going barefoot in public places**: Fungal infections can be picked up in communal showers, pools, or locker rooms. Wear flip-flops or shower shoes to protect your feet.

5. **Treat other fungal infections**: If you have other fungal infections like athlete's foot, treat them promptly to prevent the fungus from spreading to your nails.

6. **Manage underlying health conditions**: If you have diabetes, poor blood circulation, or immune system problems, work with your healthcare provider to manage these conditions effectively.

Early symptoms in infants may include:
- Yeast (candida) infections in the mouth
- Failure to gain weight and grow
- Swollen lymph glands
- Swollen salivary glands
- Enlarged spleen or liver
- Ear and sinus infections
- Upper respiratory tract infections
- Being slow to walk, crawl, or speak compared to healthy babies
- Diarrhea

Without treatment, a child's immune system weakens over time, and they may develop severe infections that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, or parasites. At this point, the illness has become full-blown AIDS."
./articles/H/HIVAIDS in pregnant women and infants.txt,What is the treatment for HIVAIDS in pregnant women and infants?,"The treatment for HIV/AIDS in pregnant women and infants is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). These are medicines that stop the virus from multiplying.

If no tumor is found during surgery, or if you can't have surgery, you may get the medicine diazoxide to lower insulin production and prevent hypoglycemia. A water pill (diuretic) is given with this medicine to prevent the body from retaining fluid. Octreotide is another medicine that is used to reduce insulin release in some people."

./articles/M/Multiple myeloma.txt,What are the symptoms of Multiple myeloma?,"Multiple myeloma most commonly causes:

- **Low red blood cell count (anemia)**: This can lead to fatigue and shortness of breath.
- **Low white blood cell count**: This makes you more likely to get infections.
- **Low platelet count**: This can lead to abnormal bleeding.

As the cancer cells grow in the bone marrow, you may have:

- **Bone pain**, most often in the ribs or back.
- **Broken bones (bone fractures)** from doing normal activities because the cancer cells can weaken bones.
- **Numbness or weakness** of the arms or legs if the cancer grows in the spine bones and presses on the nerves.
- **Frequent infections**."
./articles/M/Multiple myeloma.txt,What is the treatment for Multiple myeloma?,"The treatment for multiple myeloma can include several approaches:

1. **Medications**: These are often given to prevent complications like bone fractures and kidney damage.
2. **Radiation therapy**: This may be used to relieve bone pain or to shrink a tumor that is pushing on the spinal cord.
3. **Bone marrow transplant**:
   - **Autologous**: Using the person's own stem cells.
   - **Allogeneic**: Using someone else's stem cells. This has additional risks but may offer the chance of a cure.

Other aspects that may need to be managed during treatment include:
- Having chemotherapy at home
- Managing pets
- Avoiding infections
- Dealing with bleeding problems
- Managing dry mouth
- Ensuring enough calorie intake
- Safe eating during cancer treatment
- Joining support groups to ease stress and share experiences.

The outlook depends on the person's age and the stage of the disease. While multiple myeloma is generally treatable, it is rarely curable."

1. **Addressing the underlying cause**: If an infection is causing the neutropenia, the infection should be found and treated.
2. **Wait and watch**: In many cases, neutropenia goes away on its own as the bone marrow recovers and begins to produce enough white blood cells (WBCs).
3. **Medications**: In rare cases when the neutrophil count (a type of WBC) is low enough to be life-threatening, medicines to stimulate WBC production may be recommended.
4. **Antibodies from donated blood samples**: Intravenous immune globulin may be used in some cases.

The baby's outlook depends on the cause of the neutropenia. Some infections and other conditions in newborns can be life-threatening, but most infections do not cause long-term side effects after the neutropenia goes away or is treated.

./articles/N/Newborn jaundice.txt,What is the treatment for Newborn jaundice?,"The treatment for newborn jaundice depends on how high the bilirubin level is and how quickly it is rising. Here are the main treatments:

1. **Feeding**: Ensure the baby takes in plenty of fluids through frequent breast milk or formula feedings (up to 12 times a day). This helps to encourage bowel movements, which remove bilirubin through the stools.

2. **Phototherapy**: If the bilirubin levels are very high, the baby may be placed under special blue lights (phototherapy) in the hospital. These lights help break down bilirubin in the skin. The baby will wear only a diaper and special eye shades for protection. Breastfeeding should continue during this treatment if possible.

3. **Home Phototherapy**: If the bilirubin level is not too high, phototherapy can be done at home using a fiberoptic blanket or a special bed that shines light up from the mattress. Feed the baby every 2 to 3 hours (10 to 12 times a day) during this treatment.

4. **Intravenous (IV) Fluids**: In rare cases, the baby may need extra fluids through an IV.

5. **Exchange Transfusion**: In the most severe cases, an exchange transfusion may be required. This involves replacing the baby's blood with fresh blood.

   - **Diet and Exercise**: Changing your diet and exercise routine to include enough calcium and vitamin D, and activities like walking, jogging, or dancing for at least 30 minutes, three times per week.
   - **Avoiding Tobacco and Alcohol**: Stopping tobacco or excessive alcohol use.

2. **Supplements**:
   - **Calcium and Vitamin D**: Taking these supplements to support bone health.

3. **Medicines**:
   - Medicines may be used to strengthen bones when osteoporosis has been diagnosed, or if you have had a bone fracture and a bone density test shows a high fracture risk.
   - Types of medicines include:
     - **Bisphosphonates**: Main medicines used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, given by mouth or IV injection.
     - **Denosumab**: Lessens bone loss and increases bone density, given by injection under the skin.
     - **Teriparatide or Abaloparatide**: Man-made forms of a hormone that increases bone density.
     - **Romosozumab**: A newer medicine for more severe bone thinning.
     - **Estrogen Receptor Modulators**.
     - **Calcitonin**: A man-made form of a hormone that increases bone density, used mainly to treat acute pain from a spine compression fracture.

4. **Surgery**:
   - For severe, disabling pain from spinal fractures, surgery options include:
     - **Kyphoplasty**: A material is placed into a bone of your spine to restore the height of the vertebrae.
     - **Spinal Fusion**: Bones of your spine are joined together so they do not move against each other.

The length of time a woman should take these medicines depends on her level of risk. Recommendations include:
- **Low Fracture Risk**: 5 years of oral medicine or 3 years of IV therapy.
- **High Fracture Risk**: 10 years of oral medicine or 6 years of IV therapy."

./articles/O/Omphalocele.txt,What is the treatment for Omphalocele?,"The treatment for omphalocele involves surgery to place the organs back into the baby's belly and fix the defect. There are two main types of repair:

1. **Primary Repair**: Done for smaller omphaloceles, this surgery is performed soon after birth. The surgeon removes the sac around the organs, examines the organs for any damage, places them back into the belly, and repairs the opening in the belly wall.

2. **Staged Repair**: Done for larger omphaloceles or when the baby isn't stable enough for primary repair. A plastic pouch or mesh is used to contain the omphalocele and is gradually tightened to push the intestines back into the belly over time. Once all organs are back inside, the opening is repaired.

After surgery, the baby will need care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which may include:
- Antibiotics to prevent infection
- Fluids and nutrients given through a vein
- Oxygen and pain medicines
- A nasogastric (NG) tube to keep the stomach empty
- A breathing machine (ventilator) if needed

./articles/P/Pancreatic cancer.txt,What is the treatment for Pancreatic cancer?,"The treatment for pancreatic cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. Here are the main treatment options:

1. **Surgery**: If the tumor hasn't spread or has spread very little, surgery might be done to remove it. This can potentially cure a small number of people.

2. **Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy**: These can be used along with surgery, or on their own if surgery isn't possible. They help to shrink the tumor, kill cancer cells, and ease symptoms. When the tumor can't be surgically removed but hasn't spread outside the pancreas, both treatments may be used together. If the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy is usually used alone.

3. **Palliative Care**: When the cancer is advanced, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the cancer is blocking the bile duct, a small metal tube (stent) may be placed to open the blockage.

4. **Support Groups**: Joining a cancer support group can help ease the stress of illness by providing a place to share experiences and problems with others who understand."

The child should make most sounds correctly by age 4 or 5, except for a few sounds such as l , s , r , v , z , ch , sh, and th . Harder sounds may not be completely correct until age 7 or 8. It is normal for young children to make speech errors as their language develops. Children with a phonological disorder keep using incorrect speech patterns past the age they should have stopped using them. Incorrect speech rules or patterns include dropping the first or last sound of each word or replacing certain sounds for others. Children may leave out a sound even though they are able to pronounce the same sound when it occurs in other words or in nonsensical syllables. For example, a child who drops last consonants may say ""boo"" for ""book"" and ""pi"" for ""pig"", but may have no problem saying words like ""key"" or ""go"". These errors may make it hard for other people to understand the child. Only family members may be able to understand a child who has a more severe phonological speech disorder."
./articles/P/Phonological disorder (copy).txt,What is the treatment for Phonological disorder?,"The treatment for a phonological disorder typically involves speech therapy. For milder forms of the disorder, it may go away on its own by around age 6. However, for more severe symptoms or speech problems that don't improve, speech therapy can be very helpful. A speech therapist can teach the child how to create the correct sounds, for example, by showing where to place the tongue or how to form the lips when making a sound. The outcome of the treatment depends on the age the disorder started and how severe it is, but many children will go on to develop almost normal speech with proper intervention."

./articles/R/Renal pelvis or ureter cancer.txt,What is the treatment for Renal pelvis or ureter cancer?,"The treatment for renal pelvis or ureter cancer depends on the size and location of the tumor and how much it has spread. Here are some treatment options:

1. **Surgery**:
   - **Nephroureterectomy**: Removal of the entire kidney, ureter, and the bladder cuff (tissue that connects the ureter to the bladder).
   - **Nephrectomy**: Removal of all or part of the kidney, which may include removing part of the bladder and tissues around it, or the lymph nodes.
   - **Ureter resection**: Removal of part of the ureter that contains cancer, and some healthy tissue around it. This may help to preserve the kidney.

2. **Chemotherapy**: This uses medicines to kill cancer cells and is used when the cancer has spread outside of the kidney or ureter.

3. **Immunotherapy**: This is used when the cancer has spread outside of the kidney or ureter. It helps the body's immune system fight the cancer.

The goal of treatment is to eliminate the cancer. The outcome varies depending on the location of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread."
./articles/R/Renal pelvis or ureter cancer.txt,How can Renal pelvis or ureter cancer be prevented?,"The provided context suggests the following measures that may help prevent renal pelvis or ureter cancer:

1. **Follow your provider's advice regarding medicines**, including over-the-counter pain medicine. This is because long-term kidney damage from medicines may be a factor in developing this cancer.

./articles/R/Retinitis pigmentosa.txt,What are the symptoms of Retinitis pigmentosa?,"The symptoms of Retinitis pigmentosa often first appear in childhood, but severe vision problems may not develop until early adulthood. Here are the main symptoms:

- **Decreased vision at night or in low light**: This is often the earliest symptom. It might include difficulty moving around in the dark.
- **Loss of side (peripheral) vision**: This causes ""tunnel vision.""
- **Loss of central vision**: In advanced cases, this affects the ability to read.
- **Loss of color vision**
- **Sensitivity to bright light**

Other signs can include the presence of dark deposits in the retina, and sometimes, retinal cone cells are damaged the most instead of the rod cells that control night vision."
./articles/R/Retinitis pigmentosa.txt,What is the treatment for Retinitis pigmentosa?,"There is no effective treatment for retinitis pigmentosa. However, a few things might help:

1. **Protect the retina**: Wearing sunglasses can protect the retina from ultraviolet light and may help preserve vision.
2. **Antioxidants**: Some studies suggest that treatment with high doses of vitamin A palmitate may slow the disease. However, this should be done with caution as high doses of vitamin A can cause serious liver problems.
3. **Clinical trials**: New treatments are being studied, including the use of DHA (an omega-3 fatty acid), treatments related to genetic causes, and even microchip implants into the retina.
4. **Adapting to vision loss**: A vision specialist can help adapt to vision loss. Regular visits to an eye care specialist are important to detect and treat cataracts or retinal swelling."
./articles/R/Retinitis pigmentosa.txt,How can Retinitis pigmentosa be prevented?,"Based on the provided context, there is no definite way to prevent retinitis pigmentosa as it is often caused by genetic defects and can run in families.
